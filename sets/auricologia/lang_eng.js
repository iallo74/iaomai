Among the responsible bacteria, we find Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus fecalis. They are quite common disorders. UTIs are generally classified as lower tract infections involving the bladder (cystitis) or upper tract infections involving kidney infections (pyelonephritis). Some doctors also consider infections of the urethra (urethritis) and the prostate (prostatitis) as lower tract infections. In double organs, such as the kidneys, the infection can affect one or both organs. Urinary tract infections can affect people of all genders and ages, but they more commonly affect women, particularly those between the ages of 16 and 35. Female sex, pregnancy, the use of contraceptives such as spermicides and diaphragm, constipation, and the use of certain medications are among the major risk factors. Individuals with UTIs experience symptoms such as fever, pain in the upper back, flanks, or pelvis, as well as general discomfort, blood in the urine, and painful urination. The diagnosis of urinary tract infection is made through medical history, physical examination, and tests such as urinalysis, urine culture, and in some cases, radiological investigations. Treatment is primarily antibiotic-based, and prevention is also very important. The prognosis is good in cases of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",

It is often considered a sign that vomiting is about to occur, although that is not always the case.

Regurgitation and retching, on the other hand, are different phenomena. Regurgitation consists of the reflux of esophageal contents into the deeper part of the pharynx and does not require much effort.

			NomePatologia: "Otolithopathy",
			TestoPatologia: "Otoliths are tiny clusters of calcium oxalate and carbonate, embedded in a gelatinous matrix located in the inner ear. These formations contribute to maintaining balance and, in response to head movements, transmit the sense of acceleration to the otolithic organs of the vestibular system (the utricle and saccule). Being heavier than the matrix that contains them, otoliths stimulate the sensory hair cells in the ear when the head position changes or a movement is initiated. These cells then send signals to the brain, informing it about changes in the body's position in space. Otolithopathy is caused by abnormal detachment that displaces some otoliths from their natural position. These displaced otoliths settle at the bottom of the ampulla between the sensory receptors, and as long as we remain in an upright position, they do not cause any disturbance. However, whenever we lie down or get up, the otoliths move inside the ampulla, triggering a strong impulse to the sensors, which in turn send a sudden signal of rotation to the brain. This causes bothersome dizziness, especially when lying down. The medical term for this disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and the episodes repeat every time the head changes position, especially when lying down or turning on the side, particularly at night. When standing during the day, there is only a vague sense of instability without dizziness.",

Atypical signs such as motor disturbances (e.g., weakness, tremor, dystonia), sensory disturbances (e.g., hypersensitivity), sudomotor, trophic, and vasomotor changes (e.g., edema, sweating, alterations in hair and nail growth, changes in skin color and temperature) are associated with the pain. CRPS is typically caused by traumas, even minor ones, to a limb (e.g., surgeries or fractures). Therefore, signs and symptoms mostly affect the extremities, either upper or lower. There are two types of CRPS described in the literature: CRPS type 1 (CRPS-1), previously known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, usually develops after a precipitating event, typically a mild trauma or fracture, without significant nerve injury; CRPS type 2 (CRPS-2), previously known as causalgia, is rare in childhood and is induced by partial nerve injury or injury to one of its major branches. Among the pediatric population (children under 18 years of age), CRPS type I is more common in girls, and the average age at diagnosis is around 12 years. Lower extremities are commonly more affected than upper extremities, and some studies report a predilection for foot involvement. There is currently a lack of information on the pediatric epidemiology of CRPS type II.

This increased responsiveness of second-order neurons is an adaptive response aimed at protecting us from actual or potential damage. However, if intense, prolonged, and repetitive nociceptive stimuli are present, the central neuron may remain sensitized even after the cessation of the activating stimulus. Chronic pain has various origins, and its mechanisms of onset have long been the subject of attention, but a common pathophysiological basis has recently been identified in a group of diseases characterized by chronic pain. These conditions are grouped under the name of Central Sensitization Syndromes (CSS) because they are characterized by an altered perception of normal sensory stimuli, which are perceived in the brain as excessive or painful. They are conditions that have long been considered somatic disorders of difficult classification and often underestimated, including fibromyalgia (FMS), migraine and tension headache, temporomandibular disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and interstitial cystitis/female urethral syndrome. Under normal conditions, this process is completely reversible: when the peripheral stimulus ceases, both the nociceptor and the central neuron return to normal. However, it can happen that when peripheral inflammation stops, the central neuron does not return to its initial state.

According to Selye's model, the stress process consists of three distinct phases:<br>- Alarm phase: the individual signals an excess of duties and sets in motion the resources to fulfill them;<br>- Resistance phase: the individual stabilizes their conditions and adapts to the new level of demands;<br>- Exhaustion phase: in this phase, defenses fall and physical, physiological, and emotional symptoms appear.<br>The duration of the stressful event distinguishes between acute stress and chronic stress. The former occurs only once and within a limited period of time, while the latter involves long-lasting stimuli.<br>Stress can be attributed to both pleasant and unpleasant life events (e.g., marriage, birth of a child, death of a loved one, divorce, retirement, sexual problems); physical causes such as extreme cold or heat, excessive smoking and alcohol consumption, severe limitations in movement; environmental factors such as lack of housing, noisy or polluted environments, which are determining factors in a certain state of stress; or organic diseases: in fact, when our body is affected by a disease, the entire organism, in an attempt to defend itself, enters a state of tension which, in most cases, due to the limited defenses it can provide, results in a condition of stress.<br>People affected by stress generally experience headaches, muscle pain, especially in the back, neck, and shoulders, stomach pain, tachycardia, restlessness, sleep problems, fatigue, loss of appetite, sexual problems, and tinnitus (ringing, buzzing) in the ears.<br>The most common behavioral response is teeth grinding, but in some cases, there is a tendency towards bullying, increased use of alcohol, and emotional eating.<br>Based on the level of stress, a person may experience crying spells, anger, feelings of loneliness and helplessness in dealing with change, tension, and unhappiness without a valid reason.<br>Psychosomatic disorders related to stress include post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, psychosomatic disorders (bronchial asthma, hypertension, colitis, eczema, psychogenic alopecia, gastrointestinal ulcers), fibromyalgia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, sexual disorders, and eating disorders (anorexia, bulimia).<br>Although there is no real solution that can solve this disorder, it is now certain that by using relaxation techniques, meditation, mindfulness, neurofeedback, and especially cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, excellent results can be achieved.",

The ultimate consequence is the death of the affected brain tissue.<br>The symptoms that lead the patient to seek medical attention depend on the fact that the damaged areas of the brain can no longer perform their function, which is therefore compromised. There are various sudden manifestations, such as difficulty or inability to move an arm or leg, deviation of the mouth, difficulty articulating words (feeling of a swollen mouth), speech disorders, both in production (difficulty finding words, meaningless words) and comprehension, deviation of the gaze, and reduction or loss of sensation and/or mobility on one side of the body.<br>Cerebral stroke is classified as:<br>- Ischemic stroke or cerebral ischemia, which is brain infarction similar to what happens in the heart, caused by the occlusion of an artery within the brain due to various processes.<br>- Hemorrhagic stroke, which is caused by the rupture of an artery within the brain and the subsequent accumulation of blood in the brain tissue, compressing nearby areas and causing their distress.<br>There are several causes of ischemic stroke, among the main ones are:<br>- The presence of severe stenosis, that is, marked narrowing of the carotid artery or vertebral artery, which is the narrowing of the caliber of the arteries that carry blood to the brain due to the accumulation of lipid material and inflammatory debris on the arterial wall.<br>- The presence of heart arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, which can be persistent or paroxysmal.<br>- The presence of heart diseases, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, often resulting from a myocardial infarction, especially if it causes dilation of the heart chambers. These last two conditions predispose to the formation of thrombi in the heart chambers, fragments of which can detach and be transported through the circulation to occlude the arteries of the brain. Rare causes of ischemic stroke, especially in young age, include dissections of the extracranial and intracranial arteries and some genetic diseases.",

					TestoTeoria: "The first notions of reflexology, based on the correspondence between certain areas of the ear and specific regions of the human body, can already be found in the 'Huang Di Nei Jing,' the 'Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon of Medicine.' This is the fundamental work of Chinese medicine, presumably compiled around 200 BC.<br>Hippocrates himself described ear acupuncture techniques for treating many diseases, particularly impotence and aiding childbirth. In the 13th century, the Turks taught a practice of Auriculotherapy using massage sticks and small cauterizations for the treatment of numerous conditions.<br>In the 14th century, Flemish painter Hieronymus Bosch depicted the famous 'Garden of Earthly Delights,' in which the use of auriculotherapy techniques for the treatment of impotence and frigidity can be distinctly recognized, with a point that took its name from him.<br>In the 15th century, pirates noticed that placing a gold ring at the center of the dominant earlobe improved visual acuity. When stimulated in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), it excites the occipital brain areas, known to represent one of the seven visual areas of our brain.<br>Italian physician Antonio Valsalva, in 1717, reported on the cauterization (treatment performed with a heated iron) of the ear for toothache relief. In particular, he described a point, called H, which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown to correspond to the periodontal ligament that includes a sheath that, when edematous, causes pain. By puncturing point H, edema and pain are resolved.<br><br><b>Paul Nogier's insights</b><br>The modern history of Auriculotherapy and Ear Acupuncture is closely linked to the name of Paul Nogier, a French physician from Lyon. He observed that some of his patients with sciatica were cured through a curious therapeutic practice involving the cauterization of the outer ear. Nogier started experimenting with this method, cauterizing and then stimulating the auricular pavilion with needles.<br>In 1956, Nogier hypothesized that the representation of the spine existed in the antihelix and, more generally, that there was a correspondence between auricular points and different parts of the body. He identified the image of an inverted fetus in the auricular pavilion, mapping the human body onto it.<br><br>In his map, the human body was projected onto the auricular pavilion, taking the form of an inverted fetus. Dr. Nogier thus made an initial systematization of the auricular system, which was called <i>auriculo-acupuncture therapy</i>. <br>Based on this discovery, Nogier began a systematic study, treating different pathologies and using various combinations of points to precisely identify their locations and understand the mechanism of action of this new therapeutic method.<br><br><b>Encounter with the East and the Chinese School</b><br>In 1957, Paul Nogier proposed the first map containing 40 points, initially publishing his work in a German-language journal, which was later translated into various languages, including Chinese. <br>Nogier's map was quickly introduced in China, where it experienced significant development. <br>Already in 1959, Prof. Xu Zuolin published a work on 255 cases of clinical application in auriculotherapy. <br>In the following years, the map was expanded with over 100 additional points, and by the 1970s, it reached its peak with several hundred auricular acupuncture points. It rapidly and extensively spread, and among the first to practice it were military doctors of the People's Liberation Army of Nanjing, who published a pocket guide on Auricular Acupuncture, including a simple auricular map, clearly derived from Nogier's map. <br>From that moment, the French and Chinese paths diverged. The French school led to Auricolomedicine, while the Chinese school developed aspects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Over time, the two main schools of Auriculotherapy, French and Chinese, developed maps that diverged substantially in some localizations, with a simultaneous tumultuous growth in the number of auricular acupuncture points that lack full consensus regarding their names. <br>To address these issues, the WHO created a commission of experts tasked with achieving standardization in point nomenclature and proposing a shared map. After years of work, the results achieved by the commission were rather modest, mainly due to the tensions between the members of the two schools. In the Seoul meeting in 1987, out of the 90 points proposed by the Chinese school, consensus was reached for only 43 points based on three criteria (internationally known points, therapeutic efficacy, generally accepted location). For the other 36 points, consensus was achieved only on the first two requirements. The first 43 points were assigned a code number, a name in Pinyin, a Chinese character, and an English name. <br><br><b>Standardization and Method</b><br>From the 1990 meeting onwards, there have been no significant advancements in the standardization and classification of auricular points. Currently, in addition to the French and Chinese schools, other schools have emerged in Germany, Russia, USA, Italy, which have contributed new insights to both basic and clinical research, further promoting the dissemination of this technique worldwide.<br>Nogier's merit remains that of being the first to recognize somatotopy in the ear and attempt to systematize it. He certainly did not invent auriculotherapy, but he was the first to imagine a representation of the fetus on the ear and deduced a somatotopy, which he sought to systematize, giving shape to a practice that dates back 3000 years. <br>Modern research methods have allowed us to verify what Nogier had intuited, correct what was imperfect, and scientifically establish the criteria for a new neuro-acupuncture of the ear.<ul><li>In 1963, J. Boyer, an acupuncturist, described the electrical properties of acupuncture points, including those of the meridians that pass through the ear.</li><li>In 1969, R. Jarricot, while studying the metamers, observed the correspondence between metameric areas and the locations of auricular points.</li><li>In 1972, Jean Begue, an electrophysiologist, studied dermal potentials and demonstrated the presence of a potential difference of about 8mV between a point and the surrounding area on the ear.</li><li>In 1975, J. Bossy, a neuroanatomist from Montpellier, studied the ear from a neuroanatomical perspective.</li><li>From 1972 to 1983, R. Bourdiol worked on the neuroscientific explanation of ear points.</li><li>In 1980, Pierre Rabichong, a spinal neurosurgeon, studied the physical characteristics of ear points.</li><li>In 1979, Robert Covertat confirmed Rabichong's work.</li><li>From 1980 to 1985, René Kovacs worked on the neurology of the ear, laying the neurophysiological foundations for the study of auriculotherapy.</li><li>In 1980, Tourignan confirmed numerous auricular points, and Kruger worked in veterinary medicine on horses and dogs.</li><li>In 1985, Odine Hausach, a histologist in Montpellier, presented a study on the histology of ear points.</li><li>In 1986, the WHO recognized the effectiveness of auriculotherapy.</li><li>In 1990, the first international nomenclature of auricular points was established.</li><li>In 1994, the 1st International Congress of Auriculotherapy was held in Lyon.</li><li>In 1994, David Alimi, a neurophysiologist, demonstrated that the variations in the electrical field of ear points follow the circadian rhythm of cortisol, with a peak at 8 AM, followed by a decline and a new peak at 5 PM, followed by another decline. Cortisol secretion is virtually absent during the night, resuming about an hour before awakening, with a subsequent peak around 8 AM.</li><li>In 1997, Michel Marignan, a posturologist and student of P. Nogier, demonstrated that thermally activating points on the forearm produced thermal variations in specific points of the ear, and vice versa.</li><li>In 1997, David Alimi demonstrated the effectiveness of auriculotherapy in the treatment of nociceptive and neuropathic oncologic pain resistant to therapy, showing its superiority over pharmacological therapy.</li><li>In 2002, David Alimi, along with R.M.F., demonstrated the correspondence between brain mapping and auricular mapping.</li><li>In 2003, David Alimi confirmed the effectiveness of auriculotherapy in oncological pain through a double-blind study with a double placebo.</li></ul><br><br><b>Auriculotherapy and Universities</b><br>The Faculty of Medicine of Paris 13 Bobigny, founded in 1068, established in 1982, thanks to Prof. Carnillot, the University Diploma in Natural Medicine, including Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Mesotherapy, Osteopathy, Homeopathy, and Auriculotherapy (added at the last moment to the list of Natural Medicines). In 1992, Carnillot, a biochemist by training, proposed the establishment of the University Diploma in Auriculotherapy, and in 1995 there were 2 enrolled students! Currently, the University Department of Natural Medicine (D.U.ME.NAT.) has been established, directed by Antoine Lazarus, within which the Inter-University Diploma in Auriculotherapy (D.I.U.) is implemented. The only way to survive was to start serious research on Auriculotherapy, which began in 2000 with the work published two years later, in 2002, on the correspondence between auricular mapping and brain mapping. The initial experiments were conducted on the thumb, as, along with the lips and genital organs, they are the structures that have the widest cortical representation. A perfect correspondence was highlighted between direct stimulation of the thumb and stimulation of the corresponding auricular point for the thumb, exciting the same cortical area with millimeter precision. In 15% of individuals, the cortical representation is bilateral (right thumb in the left hemisphere and vice versa for the left thumb), which can be easily explained by understanding the role of the corpus callosum, which is responsible for routing the signals that reach it between the two hemispheres. Today, thanks to the work of R.M.F. on perfusion, it is known that the corpus callosum acts as a director between the right and left sides of the stimulation traffic it receives. This is very important as it explains why the stimulation of the corpus callosum will be of great use in some therapeutic strategies. The role of the corpus callosum also explains why we have a predisposition to be ambidextrous, even though it is known that neurologically, ambidexterity does not exist: one is either right-handed or left-handed! In so-called ambidextrous individuals, the circuits of the corpus callosum are deviated, so these people have varying degrees of ease in using both hands. In post-stroke rehabilitation, it is useful to encourage patients to use their non-dominant hand to activate these deviations, which can help in rehabilitation and motor recovery. Auricular and cortical mapping are homothetic (cartographic homothety). Auriculotherapy is therefore a microsystem, that is, a restricted area of the body where functions and structures of the body are projected and reflected. The theory of microsystems is also the basis of: - Traditional Chinese Medicine, - the Reflex-Neurophysiological Model through embryonic leaflets, - the holographic model (also called ECIWO), according to which each relatively independent part of the body, such as zang-fu organs, limbs, bones, ears, nose, etc., contains information about the entire organism as if it were its miniature; from this, it can be deduced that a microsystem can receive and/or send signals to the rest of the body. - the Neuroendocrine Model, whereby the viscera-auricular acupoint response is influenced by the combined action of the sympathetic system and the adrenal glands. Auriculotherapy should be used in support of Tuina and acupuncture, although it is important to note that often for acute pathologies, auriculotherapy is an excellent and valid method of treatment, while for chronic problems, Tuina massage or acupuncture is much more effective and conclusive."

Often, artists are left-handed, just as scientists and mathematicians are often right-handed.<br><br>The French school, unlike the Eastern one, has always attached great importance to the laterality of the patient for the choice of Auriculotherapy points. <br>We must immediately say that there is practically no completely right-handed patient (or almost none) or exclusively left-handed patient, but we would have a subject predominantly right-handed or predominantly left-handed. We should therefore evaluate various body areas such as the hand, foot, and eye.<br>This will give us the degree of prevalence of one or the other laterality, but also its harmony. The doctor will evaluate the three individual areas with simple questions or maneuvers.<br>For example:<ul><li><i>Hand:</i> which hand do you use to brush your teeth? Which hand do you use to write?</li><li><i>Foot:</i> on which leg do you stand on one foot?

					TitoloTeoria: "Point Selection",
					TestoTeoria: "Point selection is a delicate moment in auriculotherapy. The choice, in fact, inevitably conditions the final result. In summary, we could say that the choice is made according to these criteria:<ul><li>Indications of Auricular Points<br>The class of belonging of the auriculotherapy point, whether it is a functional point (I or II level) or a neuro-reflex point.</li><li>Sensitivity of the areas/points of auricular acupuncture to the semiological phases of the auricular pavilion</li><li>Patient laterality</li></ul><br>All these concepts need to be integrated with each other.

					TitoloTeoria: "Stimulation Techniques and Tools",

In this case, suitable tools can be used, such as improvised needles, but also gentler techniques such as auricular massage, which falls into this classification.<br>Prolonged stimulation, on the other hand, mainly uses semi-permanent needles. These are needles that, as the word itself says, can be left in place for several days. They must then be removed, and before being repositioned in the same point, they require a wash-out period. However, other techniques can also provide prolonged stimulation of the auricular pavilion, such as vaccaria seeds, pellets, cryotherapy, and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS).<br><br>Another way to classify auricular point stimulation is based on its intensity. That is, we have techniques of:<ul><li>Modulation of the auricular point</li><li>Disorganization of the auricular point</li></ul><br>The choice of the type of stimulation must take into account the classification of the auricular point (Functional or Neuro-reflex), the patient's threshold, the patient's age, and the subject's issue.<br><br>Modulation of the acupuncture point can be achieved through auricular point massage, metallic spheres, vaccaria seeds, laser, and taVNS stimulation.<br><br>Disorganization of the auricular point can be achieved with simple or improvised needles in all their facets (simple insertion, transfixion, embedding, criblege, etc.), but also obviously with semi-permanent needles, electroacupuncture, and auricular cryotherapy."

In the case of patients with a high threshold, we can/should use a few more needles, whereas for a patient with a low tolerance to needles, fewer needles are needed.<br><br>Normally, the younger the patient, the fewer needles are required for the therapeutic session, while in adults or the elderly, more needles are necessary.<br><br>The stimulation method strongly influences the number of needles used. It is possible to use more needles if all are inserted using a simple insertion technique, whereas if techniques such as embedding or transfixing are used, the number of needles decreases significantly.<br><br>The total number of needles used is approximately 6-8 needles divided between the two auricles. Great attention must be given to avoid over-stimulation. In the case of choosing prolonged stimulation with semi-permanent needles, it is probably useful to stimulate only one auricle to enhance patient compliance."

It describes the birth and evolution of auricular acupuncture in France and the East, analyzes the various areas of the auricular pavilion in light of P. Nogier's insights, compares and analyzes the French and Chinese maps, and incorporates them into T. Oleson's map. The soul of the book lies in the 99 therapeutic cards.
