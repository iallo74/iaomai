It supports very heavy weight loads and, to guarantee this function, it has characteristics similar to those of the foot skeleton: it is robust, but at the same time flexible, thus allowing twisting and bending movements. Here too we find a work of art of natural engineering: the vertebrae, placed one on top of the other and divided by special bearings or discs acting as shock absorbers, are kept in axis thanks to ligaments and muscles; inside the foramen, which is formed by their overlapping, they house the spinal cord, i.e. the extracranial portion of the central nervous system. It is a dense bundle of neurons from which 31 pairs of spinal nerves originate (8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal) which innervate organs, glands, skin and muscles, thus creating a direct communication link with the brain.<br /> From this brief description we can understand the importance of the spine in our well-being and it is often the part most affected by pain and stiffness of various kinds. These problems can derive from incorrect postures, repeated efforts or lack of physical exercise which is essential to keep the muscles that support the spine toned: being a structure intended to support us and guarantee movement, it is essential to train it and not remain immobile on a chair all the day!<br /> Being also connected to the viscera via the spinal nerves, it can often happen that back pain is actually due to an imbalance in the corresponding viscera, so working on the spine and viscera is essential to restore balance. This makes us understand the importance of always carrying out work on the spine, even several times during the reflexology treatment.<br /><br /> The spinal column is made up of 32 vertebrae of which:<br /> - 7 cervical (C);<br /> - 12 thoracic or dorsal (T or D);<br /> - 5 lumbar (L);<br /> - 5 sacrals welded into the sacrum (L);<br /> - coccyx (3-4 vertebrae welded together).<br /><br /> Vertebrae abbreviation:<br /> v. cervical = C;<br /> v. dorsal or thoracic = D or T;<br /> v. lumbar = L;<br /> v sacrals = S.<br /> The acronym is followed by the number relating to the reference vertebra.<br /><br /> <b>Reflex points</b><br> On the medial bone profile of both feet and, only as regards C1 and C2, plantarly.<br /> <i>Reflexes of the cervical spine:</i><br /> C1 (atlas) and C2 (epistropheus): plantarly in the center of the interphalangeal joint of the big toe (precise point is the center of the distal epiphysis of the proximal phalanx). Very important point to deal with when you have problems related to the cervical;<br /> C3: medially at the level of the interphalangeal joint of the big toe, on the bony protrusion;<br /> C4 - C5 - C6: bony profile of the proximal phalanx of the big toe, medially;<br /> C7: proximal epiphysis of the proximal phalanx of the great toe, medially.<br /> <i>Reflexes of the thoracic or dorsal vertebrae:</i><br /> D1: distal epiphysis of the first metatarsal;<br /> from D2 to D7: bone profile of the first metatarsal, medially;<br /> D8: proximal epiphysis of the first metatarsal, medially;<br /> from D9 to D11: medial profile of the I cuneiform;<br /> D12: scaphoid tubercle (bony protuberance). <i><br />Reflexes of the lumbar vertebrae:</i><br /> They are located under the internal malleolus starting from D12. Their reflection is on the talus:<br /> From D1 to D5: medial bone profile of the talus;<br /> D5: under the curve of the malleolus closest to the heel.<br /> <i>Sacrum and coccyx:</i><br /> It is a point immediately after D5, behind and under the internal malleolus and pressing towards it.<br /> NB when treating the CV we must always stay on the bone: if our finger falls in the softest area we are no longer on the spinal reflex.<br /> Recommended massage technique: the best technique is the caterpillar step (except for C1 and C2 where we will perform the hook maneuver), but we can also treat with a rotary or thumb rotation technique, if the reflexes are particularly painful, or with the technique of dispersing a sore point.<br /><br /> <b>When to treat</b><br> Work on the CV normally opens the treatment or in any case must always be carried out because it has multiple functions:<br /> - relaxes the nervous system;<br /> - tones;<br /> - works indirectly on the viscera and various parts of the body;<br /> - it is however the most stressed and subjected to loads area so it is best to always treat it.",

On each side of the phalanx we find two teeth: one upper and the other lower and their points will be on the upper edge for the tooth of the upper arch and on the lower edge for the tooth of the lower arch.<br /> The precise location will be given below.<br /> - 1st upper incisor: big toe, in the center of the upper edge of the proximal phalanx, towards the 2nd finger.<br /> - 1st lower incisor: big toe, in the center of the lower edge of the proximal phalanx, towards the 2nd finger.<br /> - 2nd upper incisor: II finger, in the center of the upper edge of the medial phalanx, medially (towards the big toe).<br /> - 2nd lower incisor: II finger, in the center of the lower edge of the medial phalanx, medially (towards the big toe).<br /> - upper canine: 2nd finger, in the center of the upper edge of the medial phalanx, laterally (towards the 3rd finger).<br /> - lower canine: II finger, in the center of the lower edge of the medial phalanx, laterally (towards the III finger).<br /> - 1st upper premolar: 3rd finger in the center of the upper edge of the medial phalanx, medially (towards the 2nd finger)<br /> - 1st lower premolar: 3rd finger in the center of the lower edge of the medial phalanx, laterally (towards the 2nd finger).<br /> - 2nd upper premolar: 3rd finger in the center of the upper edge of the medial phalanx, laterally (4th finger side).<br /> - 2nd lower premolar: third finger in the center of the lower edge of the medial phalanx, laterally (side of fourth finger).<br /> - Upper 1st molar: IV finger in the center of the upper edge of the medial phalanx, medially (third finger side).<br /> - 1st lower molar: IV finger in the center of the lower edge of the medial phalanx, laterally (third finger side).<br /> - 2nd upper molar: 4th finger in the center of the upper edge of the medial phalanx, laterally (5th finger side).<br /> - 2nd lower molar: 4th finger in the center of the lower edge of the medial phalanx, laterally (5th finger side).<br /> - 3rd upper molar or wisdom tooth: 5th finger in the center of the upper edge of the medial phalanx, medially (4th finger side).<br /> - 3rd lower molar or wisdom tooth: 5th finger in the center of the lower edge of the medial phalanx, medially (4th finger side).<br /> In practice, each toe houses the reflexes of 4 teeth with the exception of the big toe which only has two and the fifth toe which only houses the wisdom teeth.<br /><br /> <b>Massage technique</b><br /> Point rotation technique (i.e. stop on the reflex point). To make everything easier, it is difficult to treat one tooth at a time, but the teeth housed on the same finger are massaged simultaneously, using the thumb and index finger with rotary movements, i.e. pinching the toe at the level of the reflex points of the teeth between the index finger and the thumb, practicing a rotational massage.<br /><br /> <b>When to treat</b><br /> These reflexes must be treated when there are problems with the teeth or gums. The treatment is not very useful if you have decayed teeth or fragility problems, but it is beneficial in people who have a tendency to grind their teeth or who suffer from jaw pain. I have found that, in the presence of cervical tension resulting in headaches, the treatment of the dental arches combined with the treatment of the temporomandibular joint, as well as the reference muscles, can be useful.",

Often associated with the diaphragm muscle, it is a point on which holistic disciplines and practices such as Yoga pay a lot of attention because it is the symptomatic symbol of the stressful and hectic life that we lead nowadays: in fact the condition of stress to which we are subjected leads to an overstress of the solar plexus at a autonomic level, leading to a condition of &quot;energy block&quot;.

We all know that when we hurt ourselves we vigorously massage the painful area until we feel relief: this is an act that we perform instinctively and ancient man, who was a careful observer, must have understood that through massage not only did the pain in the moment in which it was present, but the benefit deriving from it was general. There have always been people more sensitive and attentive than others who have developed a very profound knowledge of nature and its laws, thus becoming capable of healing using various methods and giving rise to the therapeutic art in its various forms, including body manipulation. It can be said that foot reflexology is among these, despite not having certain sources on when it all began, but it is known that pressure massages on the hands and feet were already practiced in ancient China to regain health.</p><p> However, there are traces in history that document the use of practices similar to foot reflexology, such as the pictography dating back to 2330 BC found in the tomb of the doctor Ankmahor in Saqqara in Egypt, which depicts a foot and hand massage session. It is also known that in America the Cherokee Indians learned, probably from the Incas, to use foot massage to solve health problems.</p><p> In 1500 the sculptor Benvenuto Cellini wrote in his autobiography that he solved problems of physical pain thanks to strong pressure on the feet and hands. Around the year 1580, the Hungarian physicians Adamus and Atatis published the first text on foot pressure massage.</p><p> To have scientific bases and the first news regarding this method, as we know it today, we have to go back to the early 1900s, the era in which research began to be undertaken on pain points localized at the skin level and linked to organ problems. A pioneer in these studies was Sir Henry Head, whose homonymous skin areas we know as portions of skin connected to internal organs. According to Head, when an organ does not function efficiently it produces hypersensitivity in areas of the skin to which it is connected via nerve endings: therefore, by evaluating these areas through pressure, the state of health of the corresponding organ can be deduced.</p><p> In the same years in Russia Pavlov demonstrated how <i>&quot;Stimuli are conditioning and can provoke a conditioned response thanks to the fact that the nervous system connects all the regions and functions of the organism&quot;</i> .</p><p> In the same period, Voltolini and MacKenzie published their studies on the relationship between the nasal mucosa and the genital system: in fact, in the presence of problems with the latter, it can undergo modifications. This theory was confirmed by the otolaryngologist Fliess who demonstrated how some disorders of the genitourinary system improved if anesthesia was applied to particular points of the nose.</p><p> All this shows how at the beginning of the 1900s the foundations were being laid for reflex therapies as we know them today.</p><p> In the same years, an otolaryngologist who studied traditional and oriental medicines was working in America: William Fitzgerald (1872-1942). It can be said that the birth of Western Reflexology, as it is practiced today, we owe precisely to this doctor, even if he never worked directly on the feet.</p><p> After earning his medical degree and working in Boston City Hospital, he moved first to London and then to Vienna to further his studies. Precisely during his trip to Europe he encountered the writings of Dr. Henry B. Bressier, who documented news regarding Reflexology in history. Upon his return to America he continued his research in this direction and began to experiment with how, thanks to strong pressure on specific points of the hand, he could obtain small anesthesia in some areas of the head. His intuitions led him to divide the body into ten vertical and parallel areas which had the fingers and toes as their beginning and end, putting the organs that passed through them into energetic communication: this first map is the basis of the method that will take name of <i>Zonal Theory</i> and led him to publish the book <i>Zone Therapy, or Relieving Pain at Home</i> in 1917, expanded two years later by Dr. Bowes. His method, however, still gave little importance to the feet, focusing above all on the hands.</p><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/uomo_fette.png'/> <span>Image taken from the book <i>Foot Reflexology. The Original Method of Eunice D. Ingham</i> by DC Byers</span></div><p> As you can imagine, his research was opposed by the medical community, but not by everyone.</p><p> The <i>Zonal Theory</i> , in fact, was embraced by Dr. Joe Shelby Riley and his wife, who began to experiment and expand this new technique in their practice, supported in their work by their therapist: Eunice Ingham (1889-1974). Ingham began to apply the theory of reflex zones not only on the hands, but also on the feet, giving greater importance to the high sensitivity that the latter have compared to the hands. Her careful and constant work will lead her to compose the first map of the reflex points on the foot, on which she will work throughout her life, finding precise correspondences between the body and the breech extremities.</p><p> We owe her the birth of the map and Reflexology as we know it today.</p><p> In 1938, encouraged by Dr. Riley published the first book containing his work under the title Stories <i>the Feet can Tell thru Reflexology</i> , later integrating it in 1951 with his second book <i>Stories the Feet have Told Thru Reflexology</i> . that the feet have told through Reflexology). Ingham claimed that thanks to foot massage it was possible to reactivate blood circulation and therefore eliminate toxins (including uric acid) which could create blockages and pain in various areas of the body.</p><p> Eunice Ingham became very well known and for over forty years she lectured and taught many people her method of reflex compressive foot massage, as she called it.</p><p> After her death in 1974, her nephew Dwight Byers, who supported her since the 1950s, continued the research and diffusion of the method, founding the International Institute of Reflexology in St. Petersburg, Florida</p><p> Ingham's disciples were Doreen Bayly (England) and Hanne Marquardt (Germany) in the 1960s, who brought this technique to Europe and spread it through the foundation of various schools.</p><p> Reflexology arrived in Italy thanks to Elipio Zamboni and Erasmo Buzzacchi, students of Marquardt and Marco Lo Russo, a student of Bayly.</p>"

This thought seems to have been lost with the advent of the most modern scientific research, which has given value above all to what is demonstrable, visible and scientifically provable, leaving out a very important part of the human system represented by the mind, emotions and its habits.</p><p> With the holistic vision, therefore, we want to take up an ancient thought that sees man as a complex unit made up of multiple levels (material, energetic, spiritual, etc.) and which is part of the Universe by which he is influenced.</p><p> Wanting to give a complete definition of the term <i>&quot;Holism&quot;</i> we can make use of the description found in the Treccani Dictionary ( <i>www.treccani.it</i> ):<br /> <i>&quot;General biological theory derived from vitalism, […] according to which the vital manifestations of organisms must be interpreted on the basis of the interrelationships and functional interdependencies between the parts that make up the individual, which as a whole presents its own characteristics, which cannot be traced back to the sum of its parts.&quot;</i></p><p> This means that man (or any living being) cannot be broken down into distinct and independent parts, but each individual must be considered in his entirety and globality, composed of <i>Body - Mind - Emotions - Spirit</i> , strongly linked to the environment in where it lives, what it feeds on and inevitably connected to Nature and the Universe.</p><p> For this reason, in the holistic vision, each person is a unique individual with a unique history that is influenced by habits, lifestyle, emotions and much more: therefore each individual must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and, consequently, there are no recipes for help pre-established.</p><p> Holistic Disciplines, such as foot reflexology, therefore take into consideration the individual as a whole, considering him in all aspects: the aim is to stimulate vitalism, i.e. the Vital Force of the individual, connected to the <i>inner Master</i> , i.e. that The unconscious intelligence inherent in each of us, which makes us aware of what is good or not for our health.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Symptom concept</b><br /> In holistic philosophy the symptom is not considered negative or as something to be eliminated, but is interpreted as a message from the Body-Mind-Spirit system that something is wrong and therefore an attempt by the organism to restore the lost balance. Therefore the aim of holistic practices is not to eliminate the problem, but to identify the cause based on a broad vision of the person's life.</p><p> It can be seen as the tip of the iceberg: if the tip is broken with the aim of eliminating the entire iceberg, inevitably the part underneath sooner or later comes back to the surface, but with a different shape from the previous one; similarly, if you try to eliminate a symptom without looking at the causes, sooner or later another similar or different one will arrive, but you are far from having solved the underlying problem.</p><p> Starting from this assumption, foot reflexology has proven to be a valid technique in supporting well-being because, thanks to the evaluation of the foot, the reflexologist is able to identify the imbalances present in the Body-Mind-Spirit system and to intervene, restoring vitality and energy to the body which thus becomes capable of finding its own healing path. Let us also remember that the foot reflexologist, like any holistic operator, must be a well-being educator, leading the person to become an active and responsible part of their own health, as well as capable of understanding the causes for which their symptom appeared.</p>"

                    "TestoTeoria": "<p><b class='titTeo'>The reflection</b><br /> As the name of the technique suggests, Reflexology derives from the term Reflex whose definition is:<br /> <i>&quot;Involuntary, and sometimes unconscious, response with which the organism reacts to a certain stimulus. It can be a secretory reflex, when following a stimulus a substance is released capable of modifying the internal physiology of the body, or a motor reflex when a stimulus corresponds to a motor reaction&quot;</i> .</p><p> The nervous system registers stimuli coming from the external environment and translates them into responses that can lead to the modification of something, therefore translating into muscle movement, secretion of hormones or variation in temperature, etc. All the answers given have as their main purpose self-preservation and the maintenance of homeostasis, that is, the <i>organism's ability to maintain the balance of its internal conditions as the conditions of the external environment vary (e.g. pressure, temperature, etc. from Encyclopedia of Medicine - De Agostini)</i> .</p><p> The organ that most of all collects information from the external environment is undoubtedly the skin. It is intimately connected to the nervous system both because they originate from the same embryonic layer, called ectoderm, and because of the very high number of sensory receptors placed on its surface, which have the specific purpose of communicating with the central nervous system. These receptors transmit, through afferent pathways, the stimuli received from the outside to a central organ (brain or spinal cord), which processes a response which then reaches the effector organs (muscles, organs, glands) via efferent pathways. Therefore, if these receptors are stimulated through pressure, a response will reflexively be produced in the organism and this function can be seen as the basic principle on which our technique is based (see section &quot; <a href='javascript:SET.linkTeo(0,5);'>Hypotheses of action</a> &quot; paragraph &quot;Foot reflexology and nervous system&quot;).</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Macrocosm in the microcosm</b><br /> Every living being is made up of billions of cells; the set of multiple cells gives rise to tissues, systems and finally to the body as a whole. It can be stated that each cell contains all the information of the entire organism and that therefore the <i>Whole</i> (body) is potentially represented in the <i>One</i> (cell): consequently the large is reflected in the small. From here it can be deduced that in every part of our body it is possible to recognize the entire organism, a theory behind the reflexogenic techniques for identifying reflex points. In fact, in the different forms of reflexology, the entire person (macrocosm) is represented in a small part of the body (microcosm), where it is possible, through the correct stimulation of these parts, to act on the whole. To give some examples, we can remember that Auricology finds the reflection of the body in the auricle, just as Vietnamese Reflexology (Dien Chan) finds it in the face and obviously the foot for Plantar Reflexology and so on.</p><p> The <i>microcosm of the feet</i> therefore reflects the <i>macrocosm of the person</i> in its entirety and with all its energetic, anatomical, emotional, mental and psychological characteristics at the current moment. Like a mirror they reflect the image of the subject, with his pains, his imbalances but also his talents: this contains the extraordinary nature of this technique.</p>"

                    "TestoTeoria": "<p>There are many hypotheses on how foot reflexology works and they are still the subject of study and research, so much so that we are not yet able to explain exactly its mechanism of action.</p><p> The modern human being needs a rational explanation to validate the functioning of a method, but this is regardless of its effectiveness. Who among us has not found benefit in a massage received from a loved one, even if he or she has never studied the technique and therefore does not really know what his or her hands are doing? In this case it is difficult to justify the effect, yet the person derives well-being from it. So what is the explanation?</p><p> In the case of foot reflexology we can follow some paths that can help us understand how it works, even if they still remain theories.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Foot reflexology and the nervous system</b><br /> The nervous system is <i>the control organ</i> of physical, emotional and psychological activities.</p><p> It is divided into the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral and autonomic. The CNS is composed of the brain and spinal cord, housed respectively in the skull and the spine: they are the true command center; the peripheral nervous system includes the nerves that connect the CNS with the rest of the body and is responsible for collecting information that comes from the external environment. Finally, the autonomic nervous system presides over vegetative life and is divided into the orthosympathetic system (with excitatory action) and the parasympathetic system (with inhibitory action).</p><p> Everything that happens in our organism is governed by the activity of the nervous system which, in receiving stimuli from the outside world, translates them into actions and reactions aimed at maintaining life and balance.</p><p> The work of foot reflexology fits into this context which, through the stimulation of the reflex points, sends input to the CNS via the sensory receptors located in the dermis of the foot. At the level of the cerebral cortex these stimuli translate into responses aimed at restoring balance and homeostasis.</p><p> In particular, the foot reflexology technique acts on the skin receptors called <i>exteroreceptors</i> and <i>mechanoreceptors</i> present in the dermis and sensitive to touch and pressure: these receptors, when stimulated, convert the energy contained in the pressures or stimuli into nervous impulses.</p><p> Therefore it is hypothesized that, depending on the type of pressure and the speed with which the massage is performed, different responses and effects are obtained, since the stimulus sent to the central nervous system is different. For example, in the presence of an anxious person, we will have to carry out a light and slow treatment that will balance his hyper-excited state, on the contrary for an anergic subject the pressure stimulus will be important and faster, since his Vital Energy will have to be stimulated .</p><p> Furthermore, foot reflexology works by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to general relaxation.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Foot reflexology and hormones</b><br /> This theory is based on the fact that foot reflexology seems to favor the secretion of well-being and pleasure hormones, such as <i>serotonin</i> and <i>dopamine</i> , to which is added a possible reduction in circulating <i>cortisol</i> (defined as stress hormone), where in excess, and an increase in the production of <i>endorphins</i> . This means that among the main benefits induced by the technique is the resulting relaxation.</p><p> Today we know that one of the main problems of our society, as well as the cause of various organic problems, is stress, while a state of relaxation can be the way to maintain one's health. Therefore referring to what has been said, Reflexology can therefore be a valid tool for inducing a state of relaxation which is fundamental for maintaining a good psycho-physical condition.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Foot reflexology and circulation</b><br /> The feet are considered the &quot;heart&quot; of the venous system. In fact, at the plantar level there is a dense network of blood vessels called <i>Lejars insole</i> which, thanks to the pressure exerted at each step, allows the blood to rise towards the heart, against the force of gravity (no small feat), thus providing the first stimulus to circulatory return. This explains why, when you suffer from circulatory problems, your doctor usually recommends walking. The pressures exerted with Reflexology mimic precisely this mechanism, allowing better blood and lymphatic circulation.</p><p> The studies and research of Eunice Ingham were based precisely on the importance of a correct flow of blood and lymph, who claimed that, thanks to foot massage, the blood flow was reactivated and therefore the elimination of toxins (including uric acid) which could create &quot;blockages&quot; and pain in various areas of the body.</p><p> The nutritional materials, as well as the waste produced by metabolism, flow in the circulatory and lymphatic stream: through these channels the nourishment of the cells and the cleaning of the cellular matrix from waste metabolites are carried out, which are then conveyed to the filter organs, to be eliminated . If this system slows down, there is no longer the correct nutrition of the cells and the correct disposal of waste, thus creating the conditions for the emergence of various problems.</p><p> Starting from these considerations it is clear that a pressure foot massage produces a beneficial effect on the entire organism.</p>"

We could simply answer this question by saying that it is always useful, in any case in which you want to feel good and support your body in its functions. This answer might seem banal and a little pretentious, but in reality it is exactly like that.</p><p> As we have already seen, Reflexology is a holistic practice and as such deals with supporting the organism by promoting vitalism, so in fact it can be of help in all cases where prevention is desired, meaning the latter as the way to maintain balance and therefore a good general condition. Indeed, too often those who resort to holistic practices, such as foot reflexology, Shiatsu, etc. he comes there to find a solution to a problem he is afflicted by, but the right thing would be to &quot;use&quot; these techniques to preserve his own well-being and, consequently, not reach an imbalance. However, we know that for us Westerners this vision is very far from our culture, but the task of a holistic operator is also to educate people about this vision of health, as Hippocrates, the father of medicine, supported.</p><p> It is therefore right to reiterate once again the concept that foot reflexology does not cure anything, but simply supports the body in finding its balance. This must be very clear to the reflexologist who must never replace the doctor in making diagnoses, nor propose any alternative treatment, but rather support him and collaborate to promote the person's Vital Force. Precisely for this reason I consider this technique a complementary discipline and not an alternative to conventional medicine, because in fact it is. Hence the importance of collaboration with other professionals, holistic operators and doctors for a common purpose which is to promote the well-being of the person.</p><p> After this premise it goes without saying that listing the cases in which foot reflexology can be useful is reductive, because it would risk limiting its benefits to the conditions listed; for this reason it is much more correct to consider it as a holistic practice suitable for all those who are looking for a method that helps them maintain their vitality and support the body. Generalizing we can finally say that, being a technique that leads to a state of relaxation and relaxation, it helps the person to live better, because it allows you to think better and the body finds the way to self-rebalance.</p>"

Precisely the search for this new balance leads the body to express itself through manifestations which are always a positive indication for reflexologists, since it means that the organism is searching for its balance and has therefore set in motion.</p><p> These reactions can be more or less pleasant and manifest themselves in many ways both during treatment and afterwards, but in any case within 48 hours.</p><p> Let's see some of them:<br /> - sense of general well-being, lightness and desire to do;<br /> - feeling of light or very heavy body;<br /> - deep relaxation with need for sleep;<br /> - need to evacuate;<br /> - smelly urine and feces;<br /> - dizziness;<br /> - watery eyes;<br /> - increased sweating;<br /> - desire to cry and unmotivated sadness;<br /> - alteration of sleep (positive or negative);<br /> - particular dreams;<br /> - widespread pain;<br /> - nervous hunger;<br /> - intestinal gurgling or abdominal pain;<br /> - improvement or worsening of the initial condition for which the person turned to us;<br /> - any sensation you have never had before;<br /> - etc.</p><p> It is very important to inform the person of the possible reactions, obviously without scaring them or suggesting what type of reactions they may have in order not to influence them, but simply asking them to pay attention to what happens to their body or on an emotional level in the hours following the treatment, because indicate that the body has responded to the stimulus.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Contraindications to treatment</b><br /> <i>Primum non nocere</i> : this is a rule that all wellness operators must follow, therefore, before carrying out any treatment or giving suggestions to people on how to improve and maintain their well-being, they must be sure not to harm them in any way. way. To guarantee this, continuous and serious training is necessary on the part of operators, always practicing with conscience and professionalism.</p><p> As with other disciplines, even for foot reflexology there are cases in which it is best to avoid treatment so as not to worsen the situation of the person who has entrusted himself to us. Every operator must remember that refusing to treat a person who presents a compromised health condition does not mean not being good or prepared enough, but it means having a responsible, professional and respectful attitude towards the person himself. In some cases, wanting to overdo it leads to worse consequences than not doing it.</p><p> Let us therefore come to the cases in which it is better to abstain from practicing Reflexology or in any case proceed with caution:<ul><li> <i>inflammation in general</i> : the masseur's shared rule is to never treat inflamed areas. The same thing goes for foot reflexology;</li><li> <i>thrombosis, phlebitis and thrombophlebitis</i> : if the person has one of these pathologies in progress, we must refrain from practicing the foot reflexology treatment. If the subject has not already done so, he/she should be invited to contact his/her doctor immediately. These are pathological conditions in which Reflexology could aggravate the situation since, as we have already seen previously, it stimulates venous circulation;</li><li> <i>contagious or acute infectious diseases</i> : refrain from massaging the subject if he/she has any contagious infectious disease, since not only can the reflexologist be affected, but the subject's situation could worsen;</li><li> <i>after surgical operations (especially heart surgery)</i> : do not treat people who have undergone surgery before three or six months for the most serious cases. In the case of transplants, also consider waiting a year before carrying out a complete foot reflexology massage and in any case consult with your doctor;</li><li> <i>fever</i> : in the presence of fever it is best not to work with this method;</li><li> <i>malignant and lymphatic tumors</i> : treatment in these pathologies is not recommended due to the risk of metastasis;</li><li> <i>diabetic foot with serious complications</i> : avoid manipulating a foot in these conditions, as it is already very compromised;</li><li> <i>plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, tendonitis in general, foot trauma in general</i> : in the presence of localized inflammation of the foot, as well as trauma, refrain from practicing the treatment on the affected foot until the situation improves;</li><li> <i>Morton's neuroma</i> : it is a fibrosis, i.e. an abnormal formation of connective tissue, which develops around the nervous tissue of an interdigital sensory nerve of the foot. It normally affects the nerve located between the third and fourth metatarsals, creating pain. In these cases it is best to refrain from massaging the area affected by the problem, but you can proceed to carefully treat the rest of the foot and the unaffected one;</li><li> <i>psychotic people</i> : unless you are a psychiatrist or, in agreement with your doctor, you want to assist their work with Reflexology, it is best to refrain from treating people with these pathologies because, both due to the drugs they take and their condition, we cannot predict how they will react.</li></ul><p> Situations in which it is best to proceed with caution: in these cases, with experience, it will still be possible to treat the person delicately:</p><ul><li> <i>first three months of pregnancy or at least high-risk pregnancies</i> : the first three months of gestation are the most delicate so it is best not to treat the woman during this period; Furthermore, it should not be practiced in high-risk pregnancies since it is not possible to predict what may happen. However, it is of valid help from the fourth month onwards in pregnancies that proceed normally;</li><li> <i>menstrual cycle</i> : it is normally not recommended to treat women during the first day of the menstrual cycle, especially if it is very heavy. However, it is recommended to proceed with caution during very heavy cycles in general;</li><li> after meals: it is not recommended to receive treatment immediately after meals. If this cannot be avoided, it is recommended to eat a light meal.</li></ul><p> In light of what has been said, it is necessary, during the first session, to dedicate ample space to a correct and complete evaluation of the person (see section &quot; <a href='javascript:SET.linkTeo(1,5);'>The Foot Reflexology session</a> &quot;), to identify the type of work to be carried out or to recommend a other way.<br /> We also remember that collaboration with other professional figures is fundamental in our work and the synergy of the various techniques is sometimes necessary, to ensure that the subject regains his well-being as soon as possible.</p>"

                    "TestoTeoria": "<p>It is not possible to talk about foot reflexology without dedicating a section to what is at the center of this technique: the feet, parts of our body that are too often forgotten, but on which we live our entire life, not only physical but also emotional.</p><p> Michelangelo Buonarroti defined them as <i>&quot;a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art&quot;</i> and indeed they are. From an anatomical point of view, in fact, the foot is extremely complex and sophisticated, made up of 26 bones (plus the 2 sesamoids), 107 ligaments, 33 joints, 19 muscles and more than 7000 nerve endings. It is a fundamental structure, because all the loads generated by the body act on it and it is the basis of the antigravity control system (postural or balance system), which has allowed man to assume an upright posture and move in space, differentiating himself as well as all other living beings. It can be said that human evolution started not only from the hands with the opposable thumb, but also from the feet, thus enclosing in this thought the importance that our two pairs of extremities, very similar to each other, have on a symbolic level both in foot reflexology is manual.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Foot and brain</b><br /> At this point it is legitimate to ask why these two parts of the body attracted the attention of reflexologists starting from ancient times. In trying to answer this question we must reconnect to their sensory function.</p><p> As seen previously, in each foot there are thousands of sensory receptors that continuously provide the brain with information regarding the external environment and body oscillations, thus ensuring the maintenance of balance and facilitating the adaptation of the foot to the ground. Precisely the large quantity of receptors and sensitive fibers justifies the fact that, at the level of the sensory cerebral cortex, the feet, as well as the hands and the face, occupy a greater area than other parts of the body, as can be seen in the representation of 'Sensitive homunculus. This happens because our breech extremities are very sensitive to touch and pressure, so it is correct to think that, if they are stimulated, they bring about a much greater response at the central nervous system level than, for example, the legs. This explains one of the main reasons that have led reflexologists around the world to turn their attention towards the hands, feet and face.</p><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/homunculus_sensitivo_ENG.png'/> <span>Sensitive homunculus</span></div><p> <b class='titTeo'>Feet from another point of view</b><br /> Since ancient times, feet have had great cultural, religious and symbolic importance.</p><p> Many peoples considered feet almost regal and a symbol of beauty (think of the practice of binding the feet of Chinese women, fortunately obsolete today): among the Jewish-Christians they were an icon of devotion and humility; we can find many passages in the Bible where the feet are mentioned. Even in the life of Christ they appear several times: from the washing of the feet of the 12 apostles, up to the crucifixion which took place by means of nails that pierced them.<br /> We also find our lower extremities in mythological tales and in some fairy tales: Oedipus is hung by his feet when his father Laius has him abandoned in the woods for fear that the prophecy of patricide will come true, which will come true following his wounding by Laius at one foot of Oedipus. Cinderella is elevated to the rank of princess thanks to her feet and Achilles dies following an arrow stuck in his heel, the only point not to have been immersed in the waters of the River Styx.<br /> In a symbolic-energetic reading, which harks back to the vision of the ancient Chinese, man is an energetic channel between Heaven and Earth in which Vital Energy flows. The Earth represents solidity, materiality, receptivity and devotion, while the Sky is creativity, spirituality, intellectuality: to remain in balance there must be a correct energetic passage between Heaven and Earth. Today's man has a lot of Sky and little Earth, as he is strongly disconnected from terrestrial energy. Many widespread problems in this period are interpreted on a subtle level precisely as an excess of energy from Heaven: mostly due to mental hyperactivity and the lack of correct physical movement and contact with the Earth, these include anxiety, insomnia , stress and imbalances on an emotional level. Some practices such as <i>barefooting</i> , i.e. walking barefoot, are increasingly practiced and studied today because they help man re-establish correct contact with the energy of the Earth (for a complete reading: Clint Ober, Stephen T. Sinatra and Martin Zucker <i>Earthing: walking barefoot</i> ).</p><p> Last but not least, let's not forget that our feet lead us throughout our lives. They express the ability and will to reach the goals we set ourselves: the very act of moving the foot forward is an act of will. It is thanks to them that we can &quot;get up on our feet&quot; every day and take the steps towards Life. Both physical and emotional problems often lead to postural imbalances which are inevitably reflected at the breech level, where these variations will be corrected in order to guarantee balance: this is why thanks to the reflexological evaluation it is possible to trace the energetic causes of some discomforts.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>The foot from an anatomical point of view</b><br /> The study of the reflex zones and their treatment implies knowledge of the bone structure of the foot to correctly find the reflex points.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Terminology</b><br /> Even before examining the anatomy of the foot it is necessary to know some technical terms, which allow you to precisely identify the bone or the part of it affected or the portion of the foot examined.<br /> Let us therefore define these expressions referring both to the foot and to the body:</p><ul><li> <i>median</i> : the midline of the body/foot. In the foot we can define it as the imaginary line that separates the two feet;</li><li> <i>internal</i> or <i>medial</i> : located on or facing the midline of the body/foot;</li><li> <i>external</i> or <i>lateral</i> : looking across the midline or located away from it, outward;</li><li> <i>dorsal</i> : located at or near the top of the foot;</li><li> <i>plantar</i> : located towards or near the bottom of the foot (to be clear what is commonly called the sole of the foot);</li><li> <i>proximal</i> and <i>distal</i> : in an elongated structure they respectively indicate the part closest and farthest from the body or from the point of origin of the bone. </li></ul><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/linee_mediana_e_laterale.png'/><span>Midline (1) and lateral line (2) in the body and feet</span></div><p> To correctly identify the part of the bone to which we are referring, there is a specific terminology.</p><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/osso_ENG.png'/> <span>Nomenclature of the parts of a long bone</span></div><p> This terminology will be useful to correctly identify the points when they are located on the long bones. Long bones can be further divided into three parts, called <i>thirds</i> , which identify even more precisely the portion of the bone examined. Depending on whether they are placed distally or close to the point of origin of the bone, the thirds are defined as the distal third or the proximal third. The middle third remains unchanged. The same goes for the heads and epiphyses.</p>"

In fact, its function is to support the body weight, transfer it to the ground and transmit the motor impulse to the forefoot, which is why it has reduced mobility.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Metatarsal area</b><br /> Made up of 5 small long bones, called <i  class='clickableAnatomy' onClick=\"SET.selAnatomy('Osso',['METATARSO_1','METATARSO_2','METATARSO_3','METATARSO_4','METATARSO_5'])\">metatarsals</i> , which connect the front part (toes) to the back part of the foot (tarsus).

The phalanges articulate with each other thanks to the interphalangeal joints and the proximal phalanges and metatarsals are connected by the metatarsophalangeal joints.<br /> Thanks to the structure of the fingers and their flexibility, the complete step and the propulsive push forward can originate.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Sesamoid bones</b><br /> These small pea-shaped bones are located plantarly on the distal head of the first metatarsal, located medially and laterally. They have the function of maintaining tension and preventing crushing of the tendons of the flexor muscles of the big toe, but they also absorb part of the weight exerted on the sole of the foot.<br /> From a reflexological point of view, the tibia and fibula are also included in the bones of the foot, as they are directly involved in its movement: from here the main breech muscles and tendons originate.<br /> The <i class='clickableAnatomy' onClick=\"SET.selAnatomy('Osso','TIBIA')\">tibia</i> is a long and robust bone located in the medial part of the leg and, in its distal portion, is connected to the talus via the ankle joint; here we find the bony protrusion called the medial malleolus.<br /> The <i class='clickableAnatomy' onClick=\"SET.selAnatomy('Osso','PERONE')\">fibula</i> is located lateral to the tibia and is connected in the lower (distal) part to the talus, where it has a swelling called the external malleolus.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>The three arches of the foot: a masterpiece of natural architecture</b><br /> Just as the arches of a vaulted building support and transfer the weight of the building itself to the ground, guaranteeing its stability, so three main support points can be identified in the foot corresponding to the distal heads of the 1st and 5th metatarsals and the posterior tuberosities of the calcaneus, connected between them by as many arches which make the structure flexible, but at the same time robust and solid, favoring the maintenance of balance. We can truly define this system as a natural architectural masterpiece.</p><p> The three arches of the foot are:</p><ul><li> <i>internal longitudinal arch</i> : the main arch, located in the medial part of the foot, develops from the calcaneus to the distal head of the first metatarsal, also including the first cuneiform and the scaphoid, the keystone of this arch which is generally found at 15-18 mm from the ground. These bones are held together by numerous ligaments which provide resistance to efforts and impacts, acting like a real spring, capable of absorbing stress and discharging the weight to the ground;</li><li> <i>external longitudinal arch</i> : located along the lateral (external) edge of the foot, it extends from the heel to the distal head of the fifth metatarsal which constitutes one of the three support points of the foot. This arch is slightly raised from the ground (unlike the internal one) and rests on the soft tissues, not directly on the bones. It is a rigid and not very elastic structure, a fundamental characteristic for the transmission of propulsion from the rearfoot to the forefoot;</li><li> <i>transverse anterior arch</i> : perpendicular to the other two arches, it is included between the distal head of the 1st metatarsal and the distal head of the 5th metatarsal, passing through the heads of the 2nd - 3rd - 4th metatarsal. Its concavity is not very accentuated and rests on the ground thanks to the soft tissues; when it is very low it can give rise to the calluses typical of this area. It gives stability to the entire structure of the foot.</li></ul><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/arcate_piede.png'/> <span>The 3 arches of the foot</span></div><p> Knowledge of the basic biomechanics of the foot and its structure are necessary for the reflexologist to evaluate the problems that are often present, as foot pain detected during a treatment cannot always be referred to a reflex point and therefore treatable with Reflexology : it can in fact be caused by postural or foot support imbalances. In these cases it will be necessary to refer the subject to doctors or therapists specialized in this type of problem.

Fitzgerald's zonal theory. He divided the body into 10 parallel longitudinal zones, each of which extends from the toes of the extremities up to the head, both to the right and left of the spinal column, on the front and back of the body, feet and hands. and numbered in ascending order from the center outwards.<br /> It is thus possible to understand how each area correlates the organs belonging to the same energy line, thus arriving at the conclusion that, if there is a problem in a specific point or organ, the entire area to which it belongs can be influenced by it. In this regard, we recall the observations made by Voltolini and Mackenzie who linked problems with the nasal mucosa and disorders linked to the vaginal mucosa: in light of this theory, we understand better how the two parts are connected by the same line; in fact they belong to zone 1 on both the right and left, as shown in the figure below. </p><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/uomo_fette_vagina_bocca.png' style='max-width:300px;'/> <span>Common fascia relating to vaginal mucosa and mouth</span></div><p> The same subdivision can then be reported on the feet where we find 5 areas on the right foot and 5 on the left foot, both at the plantar and dorsal level.</p><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/piedi_sezioni.png'/> <span>Representation of the distribution of the zones on the foot</span></div><p> At this point it is much easier to understand the relationship between the areas of the body and the areas of the foot, as shown in the figure.</p><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/uomo_piede_fette.png'/> <span>Relationship between body areas and foot areas</span></div><p> In addition to the division into vertical zones, the foot is further divided by horizontal lines into four further sectors corresponding to the four main areas of the body.

It's like when you shake hands with a stranger for the first time: the squeeze must be sweet and safe, but not crushing, just as it must not be anergic.</p><p> Before starting the actual treatment, we will perform a general foot massage in order to begin to perceive the various tensions, the temperature, but also to prepare the foot itself to receive reflexology.</p><p> Normally we do not use creams or oils for massage and we should ask the person not to grease their feet before receiving our treatment, so as to be able to detect all possible alterations, both in color and dryness of the skin, important sources of information for us reflexologists.</p><p> The person must always be covered with one or two blankets, so as not to feel cold during the treatment: if you are cold your whole body stiffens and you will not have a good result.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Our posture</b><br /> The best position to perform reflexology is to sit on a liftable stool, so that we can adjust ourselves according to the person's feet, which must be at the same height as our diaphragm (here too, however, it depends on our comfort); the stool must be equipped with wheels so that we can move around the foot freely.</p><p> The reflexologist must keep his back straight with his feet firmly on the ground to support himself during work; the shoulders remain as relaxed as possible and the elbows close to the torso. You must not massage with your elbows and shoulders raised (except on rare occasions), otherwise you may run into problems with tension in the trapezius, neck and shoulders themselves.</p><p> The basic rule is that the operator must be comfortable, furthermore if some areas are difficult to reach while sitting, nothing prevents you from standing up to treat these points.</p><p> If you massage for many hours during the day, you ultimately need to practice some stretching or take a nice walk, perhaps in nature, to get our body moving, which is not made to stay still and sit for a long time.</p>"

To these techniques are added specific maneuvers, which act in a more punctual way, if an imbalance has been found in a certain area. The choice of technique to use varies based on the type of treatment to be carried out, what you want to achieve and personal sensitivity: in fact, each operator will find himself more in tune with one technique or another.</p><p> Even in foot reflexology there are various operational techniques which, although varying from school to school, have many features in common: here the classic maneuvers of Western reflexology will be taken into consideration, but nothing prevents you from integrating your work with techniques learned in other places or in other types of massage.</p><p> Before talking about techniques, however, let's start from the fact that good manual skills and sensitivity are essential from the constant but never excessive practice of Reflexology. This last point is to be taken into consideration especially at the beginning. In fact, it often happens that, overcome by the desire to learn and do, we forget to listen to the sensations that the body communicates to us and therefore we tend to overdo it, incurring inflammation and joint pain which are then difficult to resolve: the hands must be trained in a gentle and constant, to allow the muscles and tendons to strengthen properly.<br /> For convenience, the hand that actively performs the movement will be called <i>the active hand</i> , while the one that does not work, but acts as a support, will be called <i>the passive hand</i> .<br /> During the treatment, the hands can continuously exchange roles: hence the importance of learning to use them both in the same way.</p><p> Due to the particular manual skills that foot reflexology requires, it is good to have short nails because otherwise you can cause small injuries to the client (to be avoided!) or produce annoying sensations during the treatment.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Step of the caterpillar or earthworm</b><br /> It is a basic operating technique, the execution of which may vary slightly from school to school, but the basis of the movement remains the same as does its principle. It is a particular maneuver that is not found in other types of massage and was promoted by Eunice Ingham who, thanks to her research, was able to see how this compression technique is the most valid for operating with foot reflexology.<br /> The most used finger is the thumb, but the reflexologist must learn to operate with all the fingers of the hand, both right and left, in order to carry out a good job and not overly strain the joints and tendons of the same hand.</p><p> The <i>caterpillar step</i> is performed by exerting rhythmic pressure on the surface of the foot with the pad of the thumb, making the latter advance on the skin with a movement similar to the movement of an advancing caterpillar. In particular, it consists of flexions and extensions of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb, accompanying this movement with the progressive advancement of the finger. The advancement must be about half a centimeter at a time and the movement as constant as possible to encourage the person's relaxation. However, it can vary in intensity and speed depending on the case, as we will see later. During the movement the thumb assumes a flexion of approximately 120° (internal angle) and when advancing it must never fully extend to avoid detaching it from the foot.</p><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/passo_del_bruco.png'/> <span>Finger position in the caterpillar step technique</span></div><p> The other fingers of the active hand will support the foot and the work of the thumb, the passive hand will always rest gently on the same foot, keeping it in position.</p><p> The caterpillar step is the best known and most used technique, which is why it is defined as a basic technique and is useful for treating large parts of the foot, as well as systems that have a directionality in the flow of their movement, such as the digestive system or urinary.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Hook</b><br /> It is a maneuver that allows specific reflex points to be treated in a punctiform and precise manner. It is performed with the thumb at 90°, pressing deeply and upwards, i.e. towards the toes, as if our toe were a hook.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Hatching technique</b><br /> This manual skill always involves the use of the thumb but, instead of moving forward as in the step of the caterpillar, it will make small hatchings almost on the spot, both vertically and horizontally, also moving in this case half a centimeter at a time on the area to be treated.<br /> It is particularly useful for breaking crystals that are often felt especially at the level of the interphalangeal joints and for relaxing a particularly tense or contracted point or area.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Thumb rotation technique<br /> <i class='subTeo'>or energy rebalancing or rotation technique</i></b><br /> It is based on the rotation of the thumb on the reflex point we intend to work on: we place the thumb on the point and rotate it clockwise or anti-clockwise depending on whether we want to tone or disperse the energy of the organ or point we are working on. This type of maneuver serves to relax or tone a certain area or point in a very sweet and deep way.<br /> It can also be performed in advance, i.e. mimicking the step of the caterpillar but replacing the pressure with the rotation of the thumb.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Dispersion of a sore point</b><br /> It is the grip used to soothe a particularly painful point or area.<br /> It is usually carried out with the thumb, being the strongest finger of the hand, by applying static point pressure for a few seconds.<br /> The position is similar to that assumed in the pressure phase of the caterpillar's step, but the thumb in its final position reaches an angle of 90° and remains stationary on the point with a constant and rather intense pressure (the intensity of the pressure however, it is always related to the person we are treating). When the pain fades or subsides, the grip is gently released and followed by the thumb rotation technique to tone or disperse the energy of the reflex point.<br /> This maneuver promotes the release of endorphins and is normally used to sedate particularly painful points or areas, thus promoting the correct restoration of balance.</p><div class='img_dida'><img src='sets/reflessologia_plantare/img/dito_90_gradi.png'/> <span>Position of the finger in the technique of dispersing a sore point</span></div>"

This maneuver is useful in all cases of problems related to the pelvis, lower back, hips and the genitourinary area in general.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Achilles tendon strain</b><br /> This technique allows you to relax the Achilles tendon or calcaneal tendon which is a large band of fibrous tissue connecting the calf muscles to the heel bone.<br /> To stretch and treat it we will take the foot with the passive hand at the level of the metatarsals, flexing it towards the leg, the tendon will naturally relax and at this point with the active hand we will massage it as if we wanted to stretch it, following it until we perceive it distinctly. On the left foot you will work with the right hand passive and the left active, vice versa on the right.<br /> <u>Benefits:</u> the technique will produce such a relaxation that it will also be felt at calf level; it is very useful for people who have a tendency to always keep their legs tense or for those who, for various reasons, stand for many hours during the day; Furthermore, this treatment has proven to be of valid help in those who have a tendency to suffer from sciatica.</p>"

This point is the focus of the work and certainly explaining it here may not be exhaustive, certainly what will make the difference will be the combination of practice and experience that is gradually acquired with constant work and study of the subject.</p><p> The approach to an imbalance with Reflexology can therefore be of two types:<br /> - symptomatic approach;<br /> - holistic approach.<br /> The choice depends on the stage the person is in and how he wants to deal with his problem.</p><p> In the <i>symptomatic approach</i> we will work by taking into consideration the imbalance brought about by the person in the current moment, consequently carrying out a treatment aimed at the problem. This working method can be taken into consideration when the person who has come to us has an acute disorder.<br /> The symptomatic treatment therefore involves working on the reflex points directly connected to the disharmony without taking other areas or points into consideration. The meetings can be shorter than normal, but closer in time: for example, daily or three-weekly treatments of half an hour each can be established.</p><p> The <i>holistic approach,</i> however, is the real work of the reflexologist, who will evaluate the person as a whole, taking into consideration not only the symptomatic aspect of the problem, but trying to work on the causes, aided in this by the participation of the subject , who will become the protagonist of his well-being.<br /> We can divide the phases of the holistic approach into 4 stages which I wanted to give a name to help better understand the objectives:<br /> 1) the first meeting: <i>getting to know each other</i> ;<br /> 2) initial treatment: <i>lightening</i> ;<br /> 3) subsequent treatments: <i>focusing</i> ;<br /> 4) maintenance treatments: <i>the path to well-being, keeping yourself in balance with foot reflexology</i> .</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>The first meeting: <i>knowledge</i></b><br /> The first meeting is perhaps the most important moment of the entire reflexology process, because it is the moment in which the person is known in its entirety and the foundations are laid for subsequent treatments.<br /> During this meeting, various moments are planned: the initial interview, the evaluation of the reflex points and, if we are aware of them, the evaluation of the marks on the foot. (This part has not been covered in this text because it is too broad and the objective of ReflexologyMap is to provide the correct basic knowledge regarding this technique. You can however find several texts that talk about this topic, as well as attend specific courses).<br /> Thanks to the interview we can find basic information regarding the subject, starting from the reason why he turned to us. Questions will be asked about lifestyle (nutrition, sport, hobbies, etc.), any recent or past trauma to the feet, physiological rhythms (sleep, bowel movements, menstrual cycle, etc.), we will also ask about diseases or pathological problems previous or current ones to avoid operating in conditions that fall within the contraindications to treatment (see &quot; <a href='javascript:SET.linkTeo(0,7);'>Reaction to treatment</a> &quot; section).<br /> It is very important to remember that this interview is not a diagnosis, but serves exclusively to have an energetic assessment of the person's situation and their Vital Force.<br /> The interview can last about half an hour. Subsequently, the foot will be evaluated through the stimulation of the reflex points, going through the entire mapping and looking for any <i>sore points</i> , i.e. those points or areas that can be <i>directly</i> or <i>indirectly</i> connected to the problem reported by the person: the first are in relation to the problem or symptom reported, while the latter cannot be directly connected to it. Both must be taken into consideration and treated in the treatment, as they are an indication of imbalance.<br /> As mentioned before, the best way to evaluate the painful points or areas is to carry out the entire mapping of the foot, preferring the caterpillar step as a technique: this means that, already during the first meeting, a general treatment can be carried out which includes all reflex zones.<br /> Normally the first meeting lasts longer than the others, i.e. approximately an hour and a half.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Initial treatment: <i>lightening</i></b><br /> From the second meeting the real work begins.<br /> This treatment will be aimed at &quot;cleansing&quot; the body, because to start a journey it is necessary to start from an organism freed from any physical or emotional toxins, so as to make it more receptive and vital. Therefore, during the second meeting, drainage work will be carried out to stimulate the excretory organs, then ending with the verification of the sore points identified the first time.<br /> This type of work can be performed only once or for 2 - 3 treatments, also based on the assessment we made of the person during the first meeting.<br /> The duration of these treatments will be approximately one hour divided as follows:<br /> - 10 minutes to welcome the client and obtain information regarding his status and reactions after the first meeting;<br /> - 10 initial minutes of opening maneuvers (5 minutes per foot);<br /> - 35 minutes of actual treatment;<br /> - 5/10 minutes of final relaxation on the lounger;<br /> - Greetings.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Subsequent treatments: <i>focusing</i></b><br /> Starting from this treatment, the reflexologist's work will be focused on the reason that led the person to turn to this technique.<br /> After having welcomed the customer and received information regarding his status and any reactions to the drainage treatment, we can now dedicate ourselves to the actual work.<br /> In these meetings we will work on direct and indirect pain points, but organs or systems may also be treated which, although not active, play a fundamental role in maintaining well-being such as the nervous system and the solar plexus.<br /> Treatments will always last approximately one hour, divided as for the initial treatment (see above).<br /> It cannot be established a priori how many treatments are necessary for this phase; the only truly indicative thing is the comparison with the person and his reactions: as the active areas fade and his condition improves, we will be certain that we have done a good job.<br /> Normally these treatments will be performed weekly or every two weeks.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Maintenance treatments: <i>the path to well-being</i></b><br /> When we believe that the work will be completed, that is, when the reason why the person turned to Reflexology will have disappeared or at least attenuated and the subject will feel better, as well as with more energy, then we will be able to suspend the weekly meetings and opt for treatments maintenance. The meetings may take place on a monthly basis or on a different basis depending on how we deem it best to operate, whilst always comparing ourselves with the person. In this regard, it would be desirable for him to learn to feel when he needs treatment and for the reflexologist to no longer establish the periodicity.<br /> The maintenance treatments will be dedicated to the general rebalancing or stimulation of the excretory organs, in order to promote the maintenance of well-being; it will however be possible to work on reflex points corresponding to painful physical areas, if the subject arrives with some problems in the acute phase.<br /> Their duration will always be approximately one hour in which we will dedicate the first ten minutes to the initial interview, to evaluate the person's energetic state.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>Symptomatic or holistic: which path to choose?</b><br /> The choice of how to approach the problem depends both on the person who requests our help and on us, depending on how we decide to work with this technique.<br /> Normally those who turn to foot reflexology are looking for a way to improve their well-being, therefore they will want to take the holistic route, but we can find people who instead contact the reflexologist only when the problem is active, finding benefit from symptomatic treatment.<br /> On the other hand, there are reflexologists who work very well only with the symptomatic approach and others who integrate both: in fact, neither of the two approaches excludes the other.</p>"

Their condition influences our posture and represent our external expression, that is, how we show ourselves to the world.</p><p> They constitute 40% - 50% of the body weight and are divided, as we all know, into voluntary or striated muscles and involuntary or smooth muscles, while a separate case is the heart which, although it is an involuntary muscle, has a structure similar to those volunteers.</p><p> The voluntary muscles are anchored to the skeletal system thanks to the tendons and act under our will: all the muscles used for movement are part of this muscle group.</p><p> The involuntary muscles, on the other hand, do not depend on our will, but their action is controlled by the autonomic nervous system: they work to guarantee our life independently of our will and the visceral, bronchial and uterine muscles fall into this group.</p><p> Both voluntary and involuntary muscles are controlled by the nervous system which decides how and when to make them work, that is, when to excite them and when to relax them. Their movement depends a lot on what we are experiencing: for example, if we have to escape from a danger, a whole series of nervous and hormonal signals will be activated which will allow us to use the appropriate muscles for running and so on. Being so connected to the nervous system it is obvious that altered emotional states such as anxiety, tension etc. they can have repercussions on muscle tone and their functioning, so much so that when you are tense about something this state of tension is also felt on a physical level: the mouth will be tighter, the diaphragm contracted, the cervical muscles tense, etc. If this emotional condition ceases, normality will return, but if it continues the muscles will remain constantly tense and the brain will begin to register it as a normal condition and, at this point, the subject will no longer be aware of his muscular tension. Therefore, muscle-tension pain such as headaches, shoulder, back, cervical and lumbar pain can occur which may also have repercussions on the joint level.</p><p> The condition of our muscles is therefore the description of our emotional state and this &quot;reading&quot; allows the reflexologist to have information about the person and operate accordingly.

Orthosympathetic and parasympathetic work to balance each other to maintain balance.

                    "TestoTeoria": "<p>The sense organs are the doors through which we come into contact with the outside world and can experience life. Considered as expansions of the brain, they find their home in organized and complex structures, rich in sensory receptors, which collect stimuli coming from the external and internal environment, sending them directly to the central nervous system, which processes them. They are therefore fundamental for making the body aware of everything that happens outside and inside it: in fact, if we were without the 5 senses we would not be able to relate to the world and to others, but also to ourselves, with serious consequences. for our survival, because we would not have the real perception of what is happening outside and inside us, therefore being incapable of reacting to stimuli. However, there are cases in which one or more senses are deficient or even non-functional (think of a deaf-mute or a blind person): in these people nature, which is extraordinary, has foreseen an adaptation to this lack, so the functions of the remaining senses are greatly amplified, allowing them to lead an almost normal life.</p><p> The organs that house the senses are the skin for <i>touch</i> , the tongue for <i>taste</i> , the nose for <i>smell</i> , the eyes for <i>sight</i> and the ears for <i>hearing</i> .</p><p> The extraordinary nature of the human body has not &quot;wasted&quot; an organ for the sole sensory function, but rather each structure carries out other important functions which we will briefly see.</p><p> The skin, for example, is a real protective chemical-physical barrier that prevents bacteria or foreign substances from entering the body; regulates body temperature and acts as an excretory organ through the sweat glands, which also maintain the hydro-saline balance; finally it intervenes in the production of the fundamental vitamin D.</p><p> Taste is made possible thanks to receptors in the taste buds on the tongue that recognize salty, sweet, bitter and sour. However, the tongue is also essential for speaking, swallowing and for mixing food during chewing, facilitating its reduction into a bolus.</p><p> The nose, an organ common to the respiratory system, in addition to perceiving an infinite number of odors (it is estimated to be more than 4000), thanks to the olfactory receptors located in a small portion of the nasal mucosa, also acts as a real air conditioner: in fact, thanks to its structure, it filters, heats and humidifies the incoming air before it is sent to the lungs. Taste and smell are connected: in fact, if you don't perceive smells, you can't feel tastes (think of when we have a cold).</p><p> Hearing is made possible thanks to the ear, which is divided into internal, middle and external ears: in Reflexology we find the reflex points of the internal and external ear. The latter collects sounds and, thanks to sophisticated structures, sends them first to the middle ear and then to the inner ear, where they are translated and transmitted to the brain. The inner ear or vestibule is also responsible for maintaining balance, thanks to the presence of a liquid called endolymph, which works a bit like a bricklayer's level: its movement in the inner ear provides information to the brain on maintaining our equilibrium.</p><p> The eye is perhaps among the most sophisticated and complex organs of the human body and is responsible solely for visual function, even if the daylight that we perceive through this sense influences the function of the epiphysis in producing melatonin, the hormone that regulates the rhythm sleep-wake. In fact, when the retina is hit by light stimuli, the epiphysis reduces the production of melatonin, inducing awakening, while darkness stimulates its release. A person with a good biological rhythm should wake up alone at dawn and perceive the arrival of sleep a few hours after the sun sets. There are now many studies that confirm how important exposure to natural light is for the quality of our life, not only with regards to sleep, but also for mood.</p><p> The senses that find a precise reflected point on the foot are sight (eyes) and hearing (ears), since smell and taste (nose and mouth/tongue) fall within the respiratory and digestive systems, while the skin does not have a reflex point being represented throughout the foot.</p><p> Treating the sense organs with foot reflexology can be useful in all cases of inflammation affecting their structures (eyes, nose, ears, etc.), rather than in problems linked to their hypofunctionality, reminding us however that the treatment brings about benefit itself in all cases. It is also useful to combine their stimulation with the treatment of the central nervous system when the person has an incorrect perception of reality and situations since, as we have seen, life is experienced precisely through the 5 senses.</p>",

It is possible to go days without eating, drinking or sleeping, but we cannot go more than a few minutes (if not seconds) without breathing. Yet it is a function that we almost do not perceive, because we rarely happen to focus on breathing, to realize that vital air enters and exits our nose, except when we are out of breath or have problems with this system.</p><p> The respiratory system is governed by the autonomic nervous system, but it can also be controlled by our will: it is the only system to have this dual possibility.</p><p> Made up of the nose, paranasal sinuses, throat, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and lungs, it allows, through inhalation and exhalation, to introduce oxygen which, through the blood, is distributed to every cell and to expel carbon dioxide, waste element of our organism.</p><p> Breathing is made possible thanks to the diaphragm muscle, which during inspiration creates a sort of vacuum at the level of the thoracic cavity, thus forcing the air to enter, while during exhalation it relaxes, increasing the pressure in the area of the lungs and pushing the air out. The activity of the diaphragm is related to the central nervous system, so often in the presence of problems such as anxiety, stress and nervousness, you can have respiratory problems such as wheezing or general difficulty breathing. This is the reason why many relaxation techniques recommended for emotionally unstable subjects, with anxious problems, consist precisely in controlling their breathing and teaching them to breathe correctly. This does not mean that correct breathing is the basis of the well-being of all people because, as mentioned before, the molecule vital to our life enters our body precisely thanks to this act.</p><p> Having said this, it is easy to understand how the treatment of the respiratory system is not to be carried out only in the presence of problems or weakness of the same, but is fundamental in combination with the treatment of the nervous system in anxious, nervous, stressed subjects, etc. or when we want to stimulate the drainage and purification of the body associated with the stimulation of the other excretory organs (skin, kidneys, intestine, liver, lymphatic system).</p><p> <b>Additional notes</b><br /> It is advisable to treat the respiratory system in combination with the solar plexus and nervous system, in the presence of asthma problems or breathing difficulties linked to altered emotional states.<br /> <u>Warning:</u> the area of the foot pads where we find the reflexes of the lungs can be subject to Morton's neuroma.

Our existence is therefore constantly accompanied by the cardiac rhythm, which differs in two moments: the first, called systole, of pumping, and the second, diastole, of rest; this alternation of activity allows the heart to rest for several hours a day (from 8 to 12 hours!).</p><p> Its intrinsic strength makes it an organ that is difficult to get sick: problems related to the heart are mainly external to it, i.e. linked to other organs or to an incorrect lifestyle, which negatively affects the functioning of the entire system .</p><p> Simplifying we could say that the heart is in fact a pump connected to tubes through which blood flows. These channels are called arteries and veins.</p><p> Blood rich in oxygen and nutrients flows through the arteries and is carried from the heart to the periphery of the body; the advancement of the flow is favored by the pumping action of the heart and the force of gravity. Instead, blood rich in waste substances flows through the veins, which are taken from the periphery of the body and taken to the filter organs and the heart, to then be conveyed into the lungs where it is cleaned by carbon dioxide. Venous return is almost no longer affected by the pumping force of the heart, but is facilitated by a series of valves present in the veins which, by closing, prevent the blood from flowing back. The real venous blood pump, however, can be found in the foot under the sole of which there is a dense network of vessels, which promotes the return of venous blood at every step.</p><p> In humans there is in fact a double circulation: the first which brings blood from the heart to the lungs and vice versa, to eliminate carbon dioxide and enrich itself with oxygen, the second which from the heart goes to the organism, bringing nutrients (including oxygen) to all cells and collecting waste metabolites.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>The reflexologist's point of view</b><br /> Unlike the other systems represented on the foot, the areas linked to circulation are difficult to interpret, as they are almost never painful or in any case show few signs. The reflexologist's intervention will be aimed above all at a work of energetic rebalancing of the system, remembering however that the entire foot reflexology treatment already in itself stimulates the return of venous circulation, precisely because it works mainly on the sole of the foot (see section &quot; <a href='javascript:SET.linkTeo(0,5);'>Action hypothesis</a> &quot;).</p><p> Furthermore, let's not forget that the problems linked to this system and the heart are influenced above all by an incorrect lifestyle, so the wisest way to take to keep it healthy is to follow a correct diet, do moderate physical exercise (better if walking), sleep well and give space to activities that stimulate relaxation, as a condition of prolonged tension favors the appearance of disorders.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>The reflex points of the cardio-circulatory system</b><br /> The reflex points of the heart and circulation differ quite a bit from map to map, depending on whether the functional or energetic aspect is considered or whether reference is made to the anatomy of the body. The two variants proposed here are those that allow you to work on both physical and energetic points, reducing the error to a minimum. This imprecision is due, as we have already said, to a real lack of a universally recognized map of foot reflexology, which leads the various schools to consider one point more valid than another, also in relation to their experience.<br /></p><p> <b>Additional notes</b><br /> It is important not to draw inappropriate and hasty conclusions if pain or disharmony is found at the reflex point of the heart, as people often react by becoming frightened if they are told that they have detected an imbalance at the reflex point of the heart muscle. This is one of the cases (perhaps the most important) in which underestimating the client's reaction should be avoided, precisely because the heart is connected to life, not only in the true sense of the word, but also from an emotional point of view. In fact, imbalances found on the foot that concern this system are often an indication of emotional distress or incorrect lifestyles. Furthermore, we must always keep in mind that Reflexology is not a method of diagnosing diseases, that's what the doctor is for. In this regard, we reiterate that this technique evaluates the person as a whole and from an energetic point of view.</p>",

From here the lymph reaches the junction between the subclavian vein and the jugular vein at the left base of the neck, and then ends up in the bloodstream. This conjunction, in massage terminology, is called <i>lymphatic lagoon</i> .</p><p> Along the path of the lymphatic vessels, in various points of the body, there are lymph nodes which have the task of filtering and cleaning the lymph. The places where they are most concentrated are the groin, abdomen, armpits and neck. Each lymph node represents an important point for the body's defense, in fact the presence of lymphocytes inside them guarantees the elimination of viruses, bacteria and damaged cells. We can define them as the <i>sentinels of our immune system</i> , as they activate immune responses if they come into contact with foreign cells.</p><p> Lymph is a fluid that is formed from blood plasma and is rich in protein substances, lipids, sugars, lymphocytes etc., it circulates in the interstitial space (i.e. between one cell and another) with the task of supplying cells and tissues , carrying away waste substances, damaged cells, viruses and bacteria. Its flow is unidirectional within the lymphatic vessels, i.e. from the periphery to the bloodstream, also moving against gravity. The lymphatic circulation does not have its own pump, but the advancement of the lymph in the vessels is guaranteed by a system of valves similar to those present in the veins, as well as by the contraction of muscles that function as a pump. Therefore, to promote the flow of lymph, movement is essential: in fact, if you sit too much or in an upright but static position, you can suffer from lymphatic stasis, especially in the lower limbs.</p><p> In foot reflexology, the treatment of lymphatic circulation is of great importance for stimulating the body's drainage and promoting the body's natural defenses. In fact, the health of the body depends on good drainage. However, this does not relieve us from practicing moderate but constant physical activity, which is still the greatest help in promoting the proper functioning of the lymphatic circulation.</p><p> However, it must be considered that every time you receive a foot reflexology treatment, regardless of the work performed, the lymphatic circulation in general is stimulated, as happens with the venous one, so in itself this technique already acts favorably. .</p><p> <b>Additional notes</b><br /> Given the importance of lymphatic circulation for maintaining our well-being, its treatment should always be included in a foot reflexology session.<br /> However, the massage of all the reflexes of the lymphatic circulation must be performed delicately, with gentle pressure, without ever applying too much force.<br /> Normally when stimulating the lymphatic circulation all the reflexes are treated, only in cases where you want to work on a precise imbalance will you specifically stimulate a sector (e.g. only the upper lymphatic circulation). This can happen when multiple treatments are performed during the week and of short duration, aimed at rebalancing a particular problem.<br /> To be more effective, the course of the treatment should be from bottom to top, as the lymph naturally flows, i.e. starting from the lower lymphatic circulation to end at the level of the upper lymphatic circulation, which we have seen also corresponds to the lymphatic lagoon.<br /> In some maps the lymphatic lagoon reflex is shown as a reflex point at the plantar level between the third and fourth toes, on the trapezius reflex. In the technique exposed here, this point is little used, therefore it was not considered, but nothing prevents you from experimenting with it and evaluating its effectiveness.</p>",

Located above the heart, it is very active during childhood for the production of T lymphocytes and the construction of the individual immune system, while it begins to atrophy after puberty, while remaining a key organ in the activation of our defenses. It also plays the role of an endocrine gland, secreting the hormones thymosin and thymoserine.</p><p> The <i>tonsils</i> , including the adenoids (pharyngeal tonsils) and the tonsils (palatine tonsils) act as the first barrier for viruses and bacteria, preventing their entry into the airways and lungs.</p><p> The <i>appendix</i> , located under the ileocecal valve, i.e. the point where the small intestine (ileum) enters the large intestine, is the intestine's sentinel against bacteria or viruses that can invade it.</p><p> The treatment of the lymphatic organs is indicated to support the immune system and in case of general weakness of the person, but not only.

Rarely are they treated individually: these are the cases in which we want to stimulate specific points that are out of balance.<br /> It is not uncommon to find people who have had one or more lymphatic organs removed (e.g. appendectomy, tonsillectomy, etc.): this does not mean that the energetic reflex on the foot is ineffective, on the contrary, these people derive considerable benefit from the treatment of the reflex point of the removed organ, since the energy of that organ remains, as does its memory in the body. Therefore, when we want to support the immune system of these people, we will also treat the points of the removed organs.</p>",

                    "TestoTeoria": "<p>Together with the nervous system, the endocrine system is the great regulator of the body's functions.</p><p> It is made up of endocrine glands that produce hormones, substances that are released into the bloodstream and, when they hit their target organs, are able to modify their activity. Hormones can be compared to the neurons of the nervous system, i.e. messengers carrying information, but unlike their &quot;colleagues&quot;, which travel through rather short synapses and lead to rapid and short-lived responses, hormones can reach the target organs even very distant from their secreting gland. In fact, their transport route is, as we said before, the blood circulation which, as we know, reaches every part of our body. Furthermore, the effects of hormones appear slowly, but last a long time.</p><p> The endocrine glands, which constitute the center of this system, are the epiphysis or pineal, the pituitary or pituitary, the thyroid, the thymus, the adrenal glands, the pancreas and the gonads.</p><p> The <i>epiphysis or pineal gland</i> is located in the center of the skull and secretes a hormone, now well known, called melatonin. This hormone regulates the sleep-wake rhythm and is produced by the epiphysis in the absence of light, while at the first light of dawn its production is reduced.</p><p> The <i>pituitary gland or pituitary gland</i> is located at the base of the skull, in the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone. Called the &quot;mother gland&quot; it is the conductor of the orchestra as it stimulates and directs the activity of all the other endocrine glands. From here we understand how important its treatment is, not only if you want to stimulate the entire endocrine system, but for the general well-being and balance of the person.</p><p> The <i>thyroid</i> , located centrally at the base of the neck, regulates basal and cellular metabolism, the development of the body and the activity of the nervous system. It can be totally removed and in these cases people take hormone replacement therapy for life; this does not preclude the treatment of the reflex on the foot, as it is in fact an energetic and non-anatomical point.</p><p> There are four <i>parathyroids</i> and they are placed two by two on the sides of the thyroid, particularly on the dorsal side, and they secrete parathyroid hormone, which regulates the metabolism of calcium, an indispensable mineral not only for the bones, but also for muscle contraction, the nervous system and blood clotting.</p><p> The <i>thymus</i> gland common to the lymphatic system is very active in childhood until puberty, where it then begins to atrophy and the lymphatic tissue is replaced by adipose tissue. However, it continues to influence the immune system and growth.</p><p> The <i>pancreas</i> is a gland common to the digestive system and has two portions: the exocrine part (head), which secretes pancreatic juices essential for digestion, and the endocrine portion (body and tail), which instead intervenes in the metabolism of sugars through the release of insulin and glucagon, hormones that regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood by raising (glucagon) or lowering (insulin) its level.</p><p> The <i>adrenal glands</i> are located above the kidneys and produce various hormones including cortisol which modulates the response to fatigue, adrenaline and norepinephrine secreted in stressful situations, aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of sodium and potassium, and finally some sexual hormones. Today these glands are over-stimulated due to the stressful and hectic life we lead. The problem is not in fact our ability to adapt or deal with stress or fear, because as we have seen, nature has provided us with all the means to manage them, but it is the fact that these situations do not end, that is, they are not linked to our actual survival, but to a constant condition of stress that requires us to always be on the crest of the wave, especially at a work level. These conditions place a heavy burden on the adrenal glands on an energetic level, which therefore will often need to be treated to support the person's Vital Force.</p><p> The <i>gonads</i> are the sexual glands responsible for the reproductive function. They differentiate into ovaries and testes.<br /> The ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone, while the testes produce testosterone. While the male gonads maintain their function throughout life, even if activity is reduced with advancing age, the ovaries stop producing oocytes with the arrival of menopause. In this period, especially in the first phase, the woman may suffer from various symptoms linked to the decreased secretion of hormones.</p><p> The treatment of the endocrine system is, together with that of the nervous system, among the most important to carry out, precisely because of its function as coordinator of the activities of all organs and systems. An entire session can be performed working exclusively on the nervous system and endocrine system, as a general rebalancing treatment.</p><p> In Indian culture, the endocrine glands are associated with vital energy centers, called Chakras: this demonstrates even more how much our balance and vital energy are influenced by their activity.</p><p> However, given the centrality, as well as the complexity, of this system, please refer to specific literature for further information, as it is still good for the reflexologist to know it in more detail.</p>",

This type of path is very useful for all those subjects who are healthy in themselves, but suffer from general ailments whose origin cannot be understood: often in these cases the body needs to be detoxified, because it has accumulated too many toxins and the filter organs are in energy deficit.

                    "TestoTeoria": "<p>This apparatus is certainly among the most important for operators in bionatural disciplines and a book or an app would not be enough to exhaust everything that should be said about it. For obvious reasons it is not possible, so we will limit ourselves to reporting the main notions, while inviting all wellness operators to delve deeper, through specific literature, into this very interesting topic, which plays a central role in a person's health.</p><p> Thanks to the digestive system, we are able to extract the nutrients necessary for our life from what we eat. For those with a sweet tooth and food lovers, it will be difficult to accept the fact that, of the tasty dishes that fill our plates, our body is actually only interested in the molecules they are made of. The first rule therefore to keep our digestive system, and consequently our organism, healthy, is to put high quality foods on our plates, i.e. natural ones, grown without the use of pesticides and possibly cooked as simply as possible. This is because, as mentioned before, our body feeds on the molecules that make up food: if I have excellent raw materials I will also have excellent nutrients. After all, Hippocrates already said <i>&quot;Let food be your medicine and medicine your food&quot;</i> .</p><p> Having said that, let's now see, very briefly, how the marvelous human machine extracts these molecules from what we eat.</p><p> The digestive system is a very complex system, made up of multiple organs, which have the task of digesting and assimilating nutrients and eliminating waste substances.</p><p> We can define digestion as a process of continuous chemical simplification of foods, which begins in the mouth with chewing: good and prolonged chewing is in fact a prelude to good digestion. Here the first splitting of the food introduced takes place thanks to the enzymes contained in the saliva. The chewed morsel, which at this point has become a mush, is called a bolus and, after being swallowed, is pushed into the esophagus and from there into the stomach, passing through a valve called the cardia. Here the real digestion begins, thanks to the production of gastric juice, containing digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid. The latter has the function of promoting the activity of the enzymes and sterilizing the bolus coming from the mouth, which has now transformed into chyme and is ready to pass into the duodenum through another valve, the pylorus. The duodenum is the first section of the small intestine. In this point they convey both the bile coming from the gallbladder and the pancreatic juices produced by the head of the pancreas. Bile emulsifies fats and makes them digestible, while pancreatic juices continue the digestion of sugars and buffer the acidic pH of the chyme. At this point the journey of our morsel continues in the rest of the small intestine (jejunum and ileum), where the absorption of all those useful molecules that were present in our tasty dish takes place. These nutrients enter the bloodstream through the intestinal walls and, from here, are distributed to all the cells of the body to carry out their functions. The substances that have not been absorbed continue their journey and enter the large intestine (divided into ascending, transverse, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum and anus), through the ileocecal valve. In this last part of the intestine, the absorption of water and mineral salts takes place, as well as the elimination of anything unnecessary through the feces.</p><p> The activity of the digestive system is closely connected to that of the nervous system. In fact, who has never had changes in appetite or pain in the stomach or belly, linked to moments of anxiety or stress? If a person constantly experiences an emotional situation that is out of balance, one can well imagine what could happen to his digestive system.</p><p> Nowadays, in fact, problems related to this part of the body are increasingly frequent, precisely because both stress and anxiety are very present in our society, as we well know. Furthermore, the rush that characterizes our days leads us to eat meals on the run and often prepared with ready-made foods and, for the reasons seen above, this certainly doesn't help.</p><p> The discomforts that affect the gastro-intestinal tract are probably, together with problems related to the nervous system, one of the main reasons that push people to seek help from foot reflexology, also obtaining great benefits. In fact, the effectiveness of this technique in this area is undisputed.</p><p> To obtain maximum benefit, the digestive system must be treated according to its physiology, that is, from the mouth to the anus, to support its energy and, normally, this is all. Only when you want to work on specific problems or imbalances can specific parts be treated.</p><p> We also remember that the intestine is an excretory organ, so it can be stimulated whenever we want to promote the regenerative capacity of our body; to this it must be added that a general rebalancing treatment involves the stimulation of the nervous system, the endocrine system, the digestive system, ending with the kidney-ureter-bladder.</p><p> <b class='titTeo'>The liver</b><br /> The liver is considered part of the digestive system, but this is not exactly correct, as it is involved in multiple very different functions, so much so that we can define it as a real chemical laboratory. Its best-known function is undoubtedly that of being an organ capable of rendering toxic substances harmless and filtering the blood, thus contributing to keeping the body free of harmful substances and therefore being one of the main excretory organs. It is also involved in many other fundamental functions for the body, including the production of bile stored in the gallbladder and essential for the digestion of fats, the transformation of sugar into other substances to produce energy, the production of clotting factors and cholesterol. and triglycerides essential for cells, the reserve function of vitamin B12 and iron, etc. From here we can understand the complexity of this organ and its importance in maintaining our well-being.</p><p> In the treatment of foot reflexology, the liver plays a very important role because, thanks to its stimulation, the regenerative force of our body can be activated which is carried out with a greater capacity to eliminate waste substances introduced through nutrition or produced by our metabolism.<br /> It is also the organ on which emotions such as anger and frustration are somatized and its reflex point is often painful in people who live in these emotional states.<br /> For these reasons, its treatment should often, if not always, be included in foot reflexology sessions.<br /></p><p> <b class='titTeo'>The reflex points of the digestive system</b><br /> Most reflections are common across many maps, although some spots differ slightly.</p><p> <b>Additional notes</b><br /> The digestive system is among the most susceptible to disorders today. The causes are many: from incorrect nutrition to a sedentary lifestyle, not to forget the stress that too often accompanies our lives. It is also greatly affected by our emotional states, it can be said that it is the system most affected by problems of psychosomatic origin, therefore its treatment is almost always to be carried out during a foot reflexology session, obviously accompanying it with the treatment of the nervous system.<br /> We can treat the digestive system whenever there are physical problems related to it: constipation, colitis, digestive difficulties, gastric hyperacidity, etc. Foot reflexology has proven to be a truly excellent help in case of these disorders.</p>",
