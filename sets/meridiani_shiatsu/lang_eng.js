					TitoloTeoria: "Origins of Shiatsu",
					TestoTeoria: "All forms of body manipulation have their origins in a common root, as ancient as humanity itself, if not even older when considering the behavior of primates.<br>We humans share a long history of self-treatment, exchange of caresses, and mutual comfort through touch with many other living species. In this sense, we can undoubtedly affirm that massage is part of a universal heritage of all of humanity.<br>However, techniques involving pressure along specific lines or on specific points developed mainly in Asia, particularly in South Asia.<br>As the military tradition evolved in Japan, greater attention was given to the posture and attitude of warriors with swords, as well as the care of the 'Hara,' the vital center located in the lower abdomen, becoming fundamental elements of Japanese culture.<br>During the same period, the inner experience of Yangsheng practices led to an awareness of Qi and its flows within the body. During excavations of a tomb dating back to 118 BC, the figurine of Mianyang was unearthed, representing for the first time the meridians or channels. Many of the depicted lines corresponded to the classic meridians studied and still used by acupuncturists in modern times.<br>The ability and sensitivity in palpating the body became highly valued characteristics among Japanese physicians, to the extent that even today, palpation techniques distinguish various styles of Japanese acupuncture.<br>After a long period of isolation, starting from the mid-19th century, Japan began to open its doors to the West and its ideas. In particular, after 1868, a radical shift occurred in favor of Western medical practices.<br>'Anma,' under the influence of Western manual therapies, lost many of its characteristics, becoming a kind of relaxing massage. To the extent that the Meiji government established official 'Anma' schools for the blind.<br<br>Official practice of Ampuku, a massage with great healing value, ceased with the simple explanation that it could be dangerous.<br>Kampo doctors (literally, 'medicine according to the Han method') found their titles annulled, and in order to continue their practice, they had to pursue careers in Western medicine or work clandestinely.<br>In the second half of the 19th century, Western massage replaced 'Anma' in terms of therapy.<br<br>'Tamai Tenpeki' stood out as a central figure in the movement aimed at restoring the dignity of Japanese manipulation and was the first to coin the term Shiatsu, 指圧 - composed of 'shi' = finger and 'atsu' = pressure.<br>Faithful to the tradition of great reformers and innovators of Oriental medicine, Tenpeki integrated ancient theories with modern knowledge and recognized the importance of personal growth of the practitioner as a fundamental element of the discipline.<br>Staying true to the tradition of great reformers and innovators of Oriental medicine, Tenpeki integrated ancient theories with modern knowledge and emphasized the importance of personal growth of the practitioner as a crucial aspect of the discipline.<br>In 1940, 'Tokujiro Namikoshi' founded the 'Nippon Shiatsu Institute,' which later became the 'Japan Shiatsu College,' remaining the only school recognized by the Japanese government to this day.<br>Namikoshi's name is known for his strenuous efforts to gain acceptance for Shiatsu, but he also became famous for his involvement in the care of Marilyn Monroe when the actress was on her honeymoon in Japan. This episode marked a significant turning point for Shiatsu.<br>After Japan's defeat in World War II, the American occupation forces reorganized various aspects of Japanese life. In particular, General MacArthur, who was temporarily in charge of the country, compiled a list of over a hundred unregulated therapies, including Shiatsu.<br>After 8 years of scientific research conducted by various universities, it was concluded that Shiatsu therapy was the only one that met all the requirements for scientific recognition. Currently, along with acupuncture and 'Anma,' Tokujiro Namikoshi's Shiatsu is part of the only disciplines recognized by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare.<br<br>While in Japan, the practice of Shiatsu was closely guarded by the Japan Shiatsu College, led by Namikoshi's heirs, there was an intense migration of masters and practitioners to the West, leading to its global spread.<br>In the mid-20th century, Shiatsu reached the American Pacific coast along with Japanese immigrants, who continued to practice it in local communities in the form of 'anma' massage or, more recently, following the teachings of the Namikoshi school.<br>In both the United States and Europe, the practice of Shiatsu was limited to isolated individuals, both Western and Japanese, who, after studying in Japan, propagated their personal versions.<br>It was only in the 1970s that the cultural climate favored a widespread diffusion of Shiatsu. A turning point was a remarkable article on acupuncture written by James Reston, a foreign correspondent for the New York Times, after he underwent emergency appendectomy in China. This event not only contributed to the growing popularity of acupuncture but also generated a new awareness of Shiatsu and related therapies.<br>In the West, aspiring students sought explanations and teachings from Japanese practitioners. In New York, many turned to 'Wataru Ohashi,' a master with an accessible and humor-rich style. Ohashi played a fundamental role in the spread of Shiatsu in the United States and Europe, attracting numerous students to his workshops. His lessons were characterized by a playful approach to applying relaxed body weight through four-legged movements (a technique still taught in the first Shiatsu lesson for many Western students) and his personal demonstration of fluid energetic interaction between the practitioner and recipient.<br>Starting in 1977, Wataru Ohashi's lessons introduced a crucial aspect of the Zen Shiatsu style[3] [4] developed by 'Shizuto Masunaga,' with whom Ohashi had studied during his stay in Japan. This technique was based on using one hand for listening and providing support while the other hand was responsible for the operations, unlike the Namikoshi style in which both hands apply pressure.<br>In the 1950s, Shizuto Masunaga began studying at the Japan Shiatsu College. At the same time, he also taught psychology at the University of Tokyo.<br>Masunaga's work represented a turning point in Shiatsu practice in the West, and Ohashi's adoption of some aspects of his method demonstrates that in the development of Shiatsu in Europe, the Zen style[5] was predominant compared to the Namikoshi style, understood as practice rather than theory.<br>In the history of traditional Oriental medicine, Shiatsu theory had a limited role, as it is generally considered an integral part of acupuncture theory. This perception is partly due to the fact that Shiatsu practice includes both diagnosis and treatment. Through experience and skilled hands, it is possible to perceive imbalances in the body and therefore know how to act.<br>Consequently, even today, most Shiatsu teaching in Europe is based on a form derived from basic Zen Shiatsu[6] practice, supported by one of the theoretical models mentioned earlier, including the theory of the Five Elements (or, more accurately, the theory of the Five Phases or Movements), which is the most popular."

In his approach, one hand is used to listen to the body's responses, while the other applies pressure to treat the affected areas.<br>Masunaga's Shiatsu places a strong emphasis on breath awareness and an understanding of meridians as subtle pathways of energy in the body.

Understanding the theoretical foundations of TCM is essential to fully grasp the context and objectives of Shiatsu styles that utilize it.<br><br>TCM views the body as an interconnected system of vital energies and physiological processes that unite the concepts of body, mind, and spirit, promoting balance and harmony among them to maintain an individual's overall health.<br>One of the central concepts of this philosophy is the existence of <i>Qi</i> (or <i>Ki</i> in Japanese), the vital energy that flows within the body along pathways called energy channels.<br><i>Qi</i> is considered the life force that sustains life and maintains balance and health.<br>According to TCM principles, when the flow of <i>Qi</i> is obstructed or there is an imbalance, symptoms or illnesses can manifest.<br>The role of these styles is to restore harmony and energetic balance in the body, allowing <i>Qi</i> to flow freely and promoting health and well-being.<br><br>The vital energy of <i>Qi</i> is then divided into two polarized principles: <i>Yin</i> - <i>Yang</i>.<br><i>Yin</i> represents the feminine, cool, and passive aspect, while <i>Yang</i> represents the masculine, warm, and active aspect.<br>These two principles are interdependent and exist in a state of constant dynamic balance. An excess or deficiency of <i>Yin</i> or <i>Yang</i> can cause imbalances in the body, which can manifest as symptoms or illnesses.<br>The energy channels through which <i>Qi</i> flows in the body are a key aspect of traditional medicine theory. There are twelve main meridians, each associated with a specific organ, such as the liver, lungs, heart, and so on. Each channel has specific points, known as acupuncture points or tsubo (in Japanese), that can be stimulated to influence the energy flow and treat specific conditions.<br><br>In Shiatsu, pressure is applied to these acupuncture points along the channels to restore energetic balance and promote health.<br>The practitioner of these styles uses their thumbs in particular to apply pressure precisely and controlled, stimulating the appropriate points based on the recipient's conditions.<br>The main goal of TCM-based Shiatsu is to harmonize <i>Qi</i>, restoring the energy flow and promoting overall well-being.

Therefore, the dualism between Disease - symptom = symptom - cure, typical of Western medicine, is eliminated. The purpose of this publication is to provide a support tool for various professional figures who use TCM to varying degrees.<br>In particular:</p><ul> <li><div align=\"justify\">In Shiatsu, since an ENERGY EVALUATION is performed at the beginning (which varies according to different schools). Therefore, the Shiatsu practitioner operates based on the evaluation performed, taking action to rebalance the energetic patterns. Therefore, knowledge of Chinese evaluation points or alternatively, the areas of Masunaga is necessary. The meridians and associated points will then be the areas of intervention for the practitioner;</div></li> <li><div align=\"justify\">In Chinese medical acupuncture, the evaluation is performed through the symptoms and signs observable in the patient, including pulse and tongue examination.

					"<h2 class=\"btTeo\"  onClick=\"SET.swSz(this,'6');\">6. Classification of energetic imbalances</h2><div class=\"szTeo\" id=\"sz6\"><p align=\"justify\">When analyzing the energetic state of an individual, the following points must be taken into consideration:</p><div align=\"justify\"> <ul>	<li>Constitutional basis: it conditions the possible onset of certain pathologies and the individual's capacity to respond to disturbing factors. In addition to the collection of family and remote pathological anamnesis carried out by the physician during the visit, the energetic state of the Kidneys, as the seat of primordial energies inherited from the parents, must be evaluated.</li>	<li>The overall energetic state of the individual: the conditions are classified as either deficiency or excess based on the individual's overall energy (e.g., an acute illness easily starts with excess, so a good response to treatment is expected, whereas a chronic pathology that entails overall energy deficiency will result in a lesser response to therapy). Energy reinforcement in cases of deficiency should be the basis of every treatment.</li>	<li>The external-internal classification: imbalances that affect the exterior involve Wei Qi and have stronger symptoms, often with an acute onset and a more rapid response to treatments. The Lungs, as the governor of external energy, are obviously affected. Every pathogenic effect, as it progresses, affects the interior and thus one or more organs. In such cases, specific symptoms of organ dysfunction appear, characterizing the syndrome.</li>	<li>Evaluation of the current pathogenic factor: identifying the cause is essential because it must be corrected if it is endogenous (wrong habits, chronic emotional states, etc.) or eliminated if it comes from the external environment (wind, cold, heat, dampness).</li> </ul></div><p align=\"justify\">The therapeutic process based on the overall picture will certainly aim to eliminate the symptoms, but it must be based on the elimination of the causes.</p></div>" 	+
					"<h2 class=\"btTeo\"  onClick=\"SET.swSz(this,'7');\">7. Identification of syndromes based on meridians</h2><div class=\"szTeo\" id=\"sz7\"><p align=\"justify\">Since the organs and meridians are closely connected, alterations affecting the former also influence the latter, and vice versa. They are energetically separated: the meridians represent the exterior, while the organs represent the interior. Symptoms may only affect the meridian without affecting the corresponding organ (e.g., pain in the GI meridian without alterations in its function). They are caused by four factors:</p><div align=\"justify\"><ol> <li>Invasion by external factors such as Cold, Vind, Humidity, or Heat. This leads to a superficial organ disorder (Bi Syndrome). In TCM, the joints concentrate Qi and blood, allowing their flow between the interior and exterior. Many Shu points accumulate near the joints. If the pathogenic factor is associated with Heat, the joint is warm, whereas it is cold if associated with Cold.</li> <li>Excessive use of the limb, causing local Qi stagnation.</li> <li>Trauma: Qi stagnation in the meridian.</li> <li>Primary pathologies of internal organs.</li> </ol></div><p align=\"justify\">The symptoms resemble those of the internal organs and often manifest in the body orifices (e.g., if the Triple Burner is affected, ear pain and deafness may occur). The conditions of excess and deficiency in the meridians can be identified by the color and temperature of the skin along their pathway. Excess manifests as redness (Heat) or bluish tint (Cold), while deficiency appears as a pale line. Any type of pain, sensation, tingling, or stiffness indicates a problem.</p><p><b>Lungs:</b> fever, aversion to cold, chest oppression, clavicular and shoulder pain, arm pain.<br><b>Large Intestine:</b> sore throat, toothache, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, swollen gums.<br><b>Stomach:</b> eye pain, epistaxis, swollen neck, facial paralysis, cold limbs.<br><b>Spleen-Pancreas:</b> vaginal discharge, weak legs.<br><b>Heart:</b> eye pain, arm and scapula pain.<br><b>Small Intestine:</b> neck or elbow pain, stiff neck, pain on the inner side of the arm.<br><b>Urinary Bladder:</b> fever, aversion to cold, lower back pain, stiff neck, pain along the meridian.<br><b>Kidneys:</b> lower back pain, foot pain.<br><b>Pericardium:</b> stiff neck, contraction at the elbow or hand.<br><b>Triple Burner:</b> pain along the meridian, elbow pain, fever, deafness, ear pain, pain in the upper part of the shoulders.<br><b>Gallbladder:</b> headache, fever, deafness, pain in the side or breast.<br><b>Liver:</b> headache, eye pain and swelling, leg cramps.</p></div>" 	+

Only Bell's facial paralysis is caused externally.<br> Wind penetrates the skin and interferes with Wei Qi and, by affecting the muscles, causes shivering with intolerance to cold. The onset of lung invasion is characterized by sneezing, rhinorrhea (white mucus), cough, and throat itching. Fever may occur. It first attacks the external Bladder and Small Intestine meridians. If combined with cold, there is no sweating and the pulse is tense (Excess condition, pores remain closed and there is no sweating).</p><ul> <li> aversion to cold or wind</li> <li> sneezing, cough</li> <li> rhinorrhea</li> <li> possible fever</li> <li> stiffness and pain in the occipital area</li> <li> throat itching</li> <li> sweating or not</li> <li> floating pulse</li></ul><p align=\"justify\">It mainly invades the Yang meridians with joint stiffness and pain (painful obstructive syndrome, salso called Bi Syndrome) with wandering pain. Wind is associated with the Wood element and the Liver. In cold wind, the tongue remains unchanged, while in hot wind, it becomes red at the tip or sides with a thin white coating. Wind dampness: skin rashes, hives, fever, joint swelling. Wind Water adds edema. Internal wind causes tremors, twitching, dizziness, and even neurological disorders, always associated with liver disharmony: external heat produces wind (final stages of febrile illness), alterations in liver Yang, deficiency of liver blood, and causes liver wind with numbness, altered vision, and tremors.</p><p align=\"justify\"><b>Cold</b><br> Yin pathogenic factor that tends to damage Yang, carried by the wind.

They are always accompanied by feeling cold, and the pain is alleviated by warmth. It causes clear watery secretions, pale urine, loose stools, and liquid vaginal discharge.<br> Internal cold: (Excess or Deficiency) consumes the Yang of the Spleen and always leads to Empty Cold.

					TitoloTeoria: "The Story of Tokujiro Namikoshi",
					TestoTeoria: "<img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/Tokujiro_Namikoshi.jpg\" class=\"imgDx\"><i>Text provided courtesy of Master Roberto Taverna – Italo-Japanese Shiatsu School</i><p>Tokujiro Namikoshi was born on November 3rd in the thirty-eighth year of the Meiji era (1905) in Tadotsu, a city in Kagawa Prefecture. Many will remember that year as the one when Japan defeated the great Russia; the victory sparked great excitement, and throughout the country, people continued to say, \"Japan has won the war against Russia.\"</p><p>Tokujiro had two older brothers and a younger brother and sister. He was born on November 3rd, a day that is now celebrated as 'Culture Day' in Japan. At that time, it was an even more important occasion: the birthday of the reigning emperor.</p><p>His parents named him <i>Tokujiro</i> after his maternal grandfather, who had been a brave samurai. Tokujiro grew up in economic comfort until the age of seven.</p><p>Eikichi, Tokujiro's father, managed an umbrella manufacturing company, with about fifteen artisans working there, conducting business across Japan, from Hokkaido to Manchuria. However, in the forty-fourth year of the Meiji era (1911), an extended period of rain led to the company's bankruptcy.</p><p>You might think that during a long rainy period, there would be a strong demand for umbrellas, so the umbrella business should have thrived. In reality, it was not the case at the time. Umbrellas were made of paper, and after applying the paper to the frame, it had to dry. However, with the rain, the umbrellas wouldn't dry. Therefore, despite receiving a large order from Manchuria, the company couldn't deliver the goods on time. Due to a substantial debt incurred to procure raw materials, it went bankrupt. It's quite paradoxical: an umbrella company going bankrupt due to rain!</p><p>So Eikichi, turning to his wife, Masa, said, \"At this point, we can't stay in Tadotsu. What do you say we move to Hokkaido and start over?\"</p><p><i>Masa:</i> \"Hokkaido? Why Hokkaido?\"<br><i>Eikichi:</i> \"The local government told me that they are looking for people willing to relocate to Hokkaido for land reclamation work. Moreover, it would be better for the children too: in Hokkaido, with its vast open spaces, they would grow up in peace. We both know it will be cold, but we will have a home and work; I'm sure we won't go hungry. It won't be easy, but I want you and the children to come with me.\"<br><i>Masa:</i> \"Whether it's Hokkaido or any other part of the world, we will come with you. If we stick together, we will manage. Whatever we do, wherever we go. The children and I will always follow you.\"</p><p>All seven members of the Namikoshi family then moved to a small town in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan, with the intention of reclaiming and making use of their own land. Today, this place, known as Niseko, is accessible by train on the Hakodate line and is a well-known skiing destination. Back then, it was just a vast uncultivated land. The Namikoshi family made use of the available land by cultivating buckwheat, millet, and corn. Due to the extremely cold temperatures, farm work was truly challenging. Nevertheless, despite financial constraints, the family led a fairly dignified life.</p><p>Due to the drastic climate change, however, Mrs. Namikoshi suffered from severe knee pain from the very first day in Hokkaido.</p><p><i>Masa:</i> 'My knees hurt...'<br><i>Eikichi:</i> 'I really don't know how to help you... There are no doctors or medicines here.'</p><p>Day after day, the mother's condition worsened: the pain that initially only affected her knees spread to her ankles, wrists, elbows, and even her shoulders. The woman was suffering from what we now call rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>So the father called the children: 'Shigeichi, Masazo, Tokujiro, Haruo... come here. Gently massage your mother's knees and back, understand?'</p><p>The children, taking turns, massaged their mother's aching body.</p><p><i>Masa:</i> 'Thank you, my dears, I feel better now. I particularly feel more benefit when you massage me, Tokujiro.'</p><p>These words from the mother marked the fate of young Tokujiro.</p><p><i>Shigeichi:</i> 'So, Tokujiro, from now on, you'll take care of your mother, okay?'<br><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Really?'<br><i>Shigeichi:</i> 'Of course. I don't know how your massage differs from the others, but it's certainly appreciated by your mother. We'll handle chopping wood and other work; you take care of Mom.'</p><p>And so, caring for his mother became his sole occupation.</p><p><i>Masa:</i> 'Ah, Tokujiro, your massages really benefit me.'<br><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Mom, do you feel a little better?'<br><i>Masa:</i> 'Yes, thanks to your massages, the pain disappears like magic. It's not just my impression; it's really so.'<br><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Do you really think so? Then I'll do my best.'</p><p>Initially, Tokujiro massaged his mother's back very gently, gradually increasing the pressure with his fingers. 'Maybe if I do this, Mom will feel better...' Tokujiro thought as he diligently massaged his mother's back.</p><p>Apparently, the sensations from that period stayed with Tokujiro for the rest of his life, serving as the cornerstone of his career. It is said that he used to repeat the following phrase: 'The heart of Shiatsu is the heart of a mother.'</p><p>One day, while massaging his mother's back, he noticed a particularly cold and hardened area; he decided to massage more vigorously than usual.</p><p><i>Masa:</i> 'Oh, that feels good! Please, massage with more strength.'</p><p>Thanks to Tokujiro's massage, his mother experienced great relief, to the extent that the next day, she said, 'This morning, I don't feel any pain, and I feel very well. The massage Tokujiro gave me yesterday evening really worked!' Tokujiro continued to massage for days and days until the hardness disappeared, and his mother, who had actually been suffering from rheumatism, felt better. Within a few years, his mother's condition improved so much that she was even able to participate in fieldwork.</p><p>The area that Tokujiro was massaging corresponded to the adrenal gland: the adrenal gland secretes the hormone cortisol. That's why his massages were so effective.</p><p>Was it his instinct that showed him where and how to massage? Or perhaps it was divine will moved by a son's strong desire to see his mother healed.</p><p>One day, at school, during the morning assembly, the principal suddenly called Tokujiro and ordered him to stand in front of his classmates and the emperor's photo. 'What's going on?' thought the worried boy. Principal (addressing the students): 'Kids, you must respect and love your parents. Your classmate Namikoshi lovingly massaged his mother's back every day until she was healed. Take him as a role model and always be devoted to your parents.'</p><p>Naturally, receiving praise from the principal in front of everyone made young Tokujiro very happy. The mother's recovery had already been a great source of joy for him, but receiving the school principal's accolades elevated him to cloud nine!</p><p>It was at that moment that Tokujiro thought, 'I will do everything to help others, and I will work to heal those who are unwell!'</p><p>Once he turned seventeen (in the eleventh year of the Taisho era), Tokujiro decided to move to Tokyo to learn various massage techniques. He set off alone with a meager sum of 11 yen and 50 cents, borrowed from his older brother. In Tokyo, however, he didn't know any massage practitioners from whom he could gain valuable teachings. It's needless to say that at that time, there were no massage schools. While he was looking for a massage teacher to take him as a student, he started delivering newspapers to make a living. Fortunately, Tokujiro had no trouble finding new clients.</p><p><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Sir, you look a bit pale... I think you're not well.'<br><i>Customer:</i> 'Well, lately I've had terrible back pain.'<br><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Let me take a look... if you'd like, I can give you a massage.'<br><i>Customer:</i> 'And should I get a massage from a newspaper delivery boy? No, thank you, but it's not necessary. ... Well, if you really insist... Ah, what relief! I don't feel any pain now. Thank you, you're truly amazing. I'd like to repay your kindness in some way.'<br><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Don't trouble yourself. It's not necessary.'<br><i>Customer:</i> 'No, I insist. Let me do something for you.'<br><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'If you really want to help me, then subscribe to the Asahi newspaper (the one he was working for). Even just for one month.'</p><p>This way, Tokujiro managed to get many people to subscribe, and the newspaper agent, impressed by the young man's determination, said, 'Why don't you become a newspaper agent too? If you give up on becoming a masseur, I'll get you your own store.'</p><p>But Tokujiro resisted the temptation. He quit working for the newspaper agent and became a student of Yoshimasu Odagawa, a massage practitioner he learned about from a magazine. After four years of study, he took the professional qualification exam. As for the practical exam, Tokujiro was tasked with massaging the examiner, who happened to have back pain that day.</p><p><i>Examiner:</i> 'You're quite good. Please continue.'</p><p>So, even during the examination, the examiner let Tokujiro continue massaging him. Naturally, Tokujiro passed the exam with flying colors.</p><p>It is said that on the day of the exam, his mother, still in Hokkaido, went to the Hachiman Shinto shrine to pray for her son to pass the exam.</p><p>In September of the fourteenth year of the Taisho era (1925), Tokujiro returned to Hokkaido and opened a massage center in the city of Muroran. With the help of the Minister of Environmental Protection (his client), he managed to open his studio right in the city center, in Susukino. His brother Haruo and his sister Sadako also became massage practitioners, and Tokujiro decided to take on four more relatives as students. Thanks to recommendations from the said minister, Tokujiro quickly gained many clients and built an excellent reputation.</p><p>In February of the fifth year of the Showa era (1930), the Otaru newspaper invited Gohei Ishimaru, a renowned ideologist and author, to give a lecture in Sapporo. Being extremely famous, a large number of people attended the lecture, despite heavy snowfall. Unfortunately, the author suffered a heart attack after arriving at Sapporo station. The doctor who examined him ordered complete rest, which meant canceling the lecture.</p><p>At this point, a journalist from the Otaru newspaper said, 'I've heard there's a masseur in Sapporo, a certain Namikoshi; it seems he's very skilled and can cure any illness through massages. I'd try calling him. Maybe it won't help, but it's always worth a try. What do you think?'</p><p>Tokujiro arrived promptly and placed his hands on Ishimaru's stomach. By doing so, Tokujiro could learn about the patients' conditions.</p><p><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Don't worry. You'll be able to give the lecture.'<br><i>Journalist:</i> 'Really? Mr. Namikoshi, please do your best.'</p><p>Thanks to a two-hour massage, Ishimaru began to recover. Ishimaru: 'Yes, yes, I'm feeling better. I should be able to speak. Mr. Namikoshi, I sincerely thank you.'</p><p>Thus, Ishimaru was able to complete the lecture without any issues. Ishimaru: 'Mr. Namikoshi, your fingers have something magical about them. Thanks to you, I'm well now and didn't miss the lecture. I'd like to repay you: I'll insure your fingers for a hundred thousand yen.'</p><p>A hundred thousand yen from the fifth year of the Showa era corresponds to hundreds of millions of yen today. Such a sum was spent to insure only Tokujiro's thumbs. Of course, the news caused a sensation, and a newspaper article with six columns (normally one newspaper page contains fifteen) was published, titled 'these fingers cost a hundred thousand yen.' By the way, the most expensive insurance in Japan up to that point was for Saburo Miyatake's right arm, a famous baseball pitcher, insured for two hundred thousand yen, followed by the actress Yaeko Mizutani's one hundred fifty thousand yen insurance to protect her beauty, and then Gokuro Soganoya, a comedian, insured his bald head for a hundred thousand yen (he thought that if his hair grew back, he wouldn't have the same success). So you can imagine that a hundred thousand yen was a huge amount at that time.</p><p>Later, driven by the desire to help as many people as possible, Tokujiro decided to return to Tokyo and promote Shiatsu. So, in the eighth year of the Showa era (1933), he entrusted the massage center in Sapporo to his brother Haruo and the others and returned to Tokyo. Unlike nine years earlier, when he went there alone without any acquaintances, this time he was with his wife and three children and had the support of many people. But even on that occasion, Tokujiro had a hard time achieving stability. Despite having many sumo wrestlers as clients, they would leave after the tournament season, taking their earnings with them...</p><p>He was forced to move seven times, and finally, he opened his new Shiatsu studio in Koishikawa, in front of the Dentsuuin temple.</p><p>Tokujiro: 'Both the building's structure and the location seem good to me. It's an ideal arrangement for my Shiatsu studio. They say that in life, after making seven mistakes, the eighth time brings success. I moved seven times, and now on the eighth move, I have arrived here. It's a sign of destiny. I'll settle here and won't move until I succeed.'</p><p>So he settled there, gained many clients, and enjoyed good financial success.</p><p>At that time, Japan followed the Kouki calendar, in which year zero corresponded to the year of Emperor Jinmu's birth. Thus, the fifteenth year of the Showa era was equivalent to the year 2600. All over the country, people celebrated the umpteenth centenary of Emperor Jinmu's birth (there's even a song dedicated to this year, but I'll spare you). In such a special year, Tokujiro decided to do something unique and innovative. Can you imagine what it was?</p><p>It was a Shiatsu school.</p><p>'It will be difficult to spread Shiatsu alone; we need a group and successors.' Tokujiro remembered the hard times he had in Tokyo fifteen years ago when he had no recommendations and no acquaintances. Before finding his own master, he slept in Ueno Park and worked as a newspaper delivery boy. 'If we establish a school, young people with the same motivation as mine won't have to struggle like I did.'</p><p>So the \"Nihon Shiatsu Gakuin,\" or the \"Japanese Shiatsu School,\" was born. However, don't be fooled by the term \"school.\" In reality, no more than fifteen students were admitted, and the available space consisted of two rooms, each 13.2 square meters.</p><p>On the day of the opening, there was an unexpected visit: Masa, who had been completely healed by Tokujiro's treatments despite her age of 70, undertook a long train journey to express her gratitude to her son. Tokujiro: 'Mom, did you come to celebrate the school's opening? I imagine the journey was tiring. Anyway, I'm very happy to see you. Thank you so much for being here.'</p><p><i>Masa: </i>'No, I didn't come to celebrate.'<br>  <i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Really? Then, what's the pleasure of your visit?'<br>  <i>Masa:</i> 'When you open a school, it's not pleasant to have only a few students, right? I'm actually here to attend the school, to become one of your students. Is that possible?.'<br>  <i>Tokujiro: </i>'Mom, are you serious?.'<br>  <i>Masa:</i> 'Doesn't it make you happy, Tokujiro? Or should I say, Master Namikoshi?.'<br><i>Tokujiro:</i> 'Mom, thank you. I am deeply grateful to you, and I ask you to attend the school. It's an honor for me.'</p><p>The thought of his mother made Tokujiro truly happy.</p><p>Indeed, no one knew better than Masa how effective Tokujiro's massage was. Moreover, she shared the same desire as Tokujiro, which was to help suffering people, just as she had been helped in the past.</p><p>So, Masa became one of the first students of the \"Japanese Shiatsu School.\" It would have been strange to call one of his students \"Mom,\" and he couldn't call her by her last name, as they shared the same surname. He decided to call her \"Mrs. Ikeda\" (her maiden name).</p><p>Masa attended the school for a whole year and, once she finished, she returned to Hokkaido and started massaging her neighbors. To avoid being considered an amateur, she always carried the diploma from the \"Japanese Shiatsu School\" and said she had learned Shiatsu from a renowned master in Tokyo. Since Japanese people, by culture, are usually modest and don't praise their family members, Masa's words might sound strange. In reality, this indicated that Masa esteemed her son not as her son but as a Shiatsu master.</p><p>Masa, at the age of eighty, fell while on her way to a patient and passed away. Until her last day, she treated her neighbors with the Shiatsu she had learned from Tokujiro.</p><p>The school trained many masseurs, and Tokujiro's clientele grew. However, in the nineteenth year of the Showa era (1944), Tokyo was repeatedly bombed by American B29s, and many houses, including Tokujiro's, were set on fire. The Namikoshi family was forced to move to Akita Prefecture, and here too, Tokujiro was well received. People paid for his massages with rice and vegetables, so despite the war, the family had no trouble finding food. And this was also thanks to Tokujiro's thumbs.</p><p>When he heard on the radio that Emperor Hirohito officially announced the end of the war, Tokujiro returned to Tokyo, but he found only the remnants of the school, which was almost completely burned down. He stood alone and thought, 'I lost my house and the school; I lost all my material possessions. But I still have my thumbs, which are my most precious possession, my life. I can start over once more... in fact, with the money I'll earn thanks to my thumbs, I'll rebuild Japan! Nothing is impossible if you really want it.' And he chuckled in satisfaction.</p><p>'To rebuild Japan, I first need to take care of people's health.' Keeping these words in mind, he rented a house where he started a new school. Some of his early students later became teachers at the school itself, and in less than a year, they managed to rebuild the school building on May 25th of the twenty-first year of the Showa era (1946).</p><p>And so, after the war, the school's activities resumed. Tokujiro had numerous famous clients, including politicians Shigeru Yoshida, Eiji Yoshikawa, Kan Kikuchi, Sanjugo Noki, and Yuzo Yamamoto, natural science professor Jun Ishihara, sumo wrestlers Minanogawa and Kotogahama, boxer Kuniaki Shibata, baseball player Shigeo Nagashima, actors Kikugoro Seventh and Sesshu Hayakawa (a renowned international actor), and many others.</p><p>One day, in the thirtieth year of the Showa era (1955), Tokujiro's phone rang at five in the morning.</p><p>Tokujiro: 'Who could it be at this hour?... Hello? Yes, this is Namikoshi.'<br>Caller: 'I apologize for disturbing you at this hour... I'm O'Doul. We'll have time later for greetings and a chat, but right now, you should come immediately to the Imperial Hotel without telling anyone; there is someone here I'd like you to visit right away.'</p><p>Obviously, Tokujiro was perplexed by such a specific request. Still, since he would never refuse to treat a patient, he hurried to the Imperial Hotel.</p><p>The person waiting for Tokujiro in the lobby was the coach of the San Francisco Shield team, Frank O'Doul. Tokujiro had met and treated him a few years earlier when he visited Japan and suffered from kidney pain due to golf.</p><p><i>O'Doul: </i>'Mr. Namikoshi, you really must help us heal this person...'<br><i>Tokujiro: </i>'Yes, don't worry, but... who do I need to heal?'<br><i>American boy:</i> 'Come with me, and you'll understand.'</p><p>Tokujiro followed the boy to room number 205, and when he opened the door, he was speechless: in front of him was none other than the baseball player Joe DiMaggio, someone he had seen many times on TV. The champion was in Japan for his honeymoon. That means... Yes, that's right: the patient in question was Joe DiMaggio's wife, the beautiful Marilyn Monroe.</p><p><i>American boy:</i> 'Marilyn is suffering from gastric spasms, but she doesn't want to take medicine and also refuses injections. Dr. Namikoshi, only you can help us. Please, do your best.'<p> I understand. I will try to heal her.' Tokujiro replied with embarrassment. He had just been asked to massage the fantastic Marilyn Monroe... can you imagine: a beautiful woman lying on the bed, wearing only a drop of Chanel Number 5... No, I'm joking! She had a robe. We know, however, that massages are not done with a robe... It seems that after that day, everyone always asked him, 'Mr. Namikoshi, as a man, what did you feel about massaging Marilyn Monroe?' To which Tokujiro replied, 'Don't kid around. Once you reach a certain level of professionalism, you never lose concentration, in any situation. Hahahahah.'</p><p>And so, Tokujiro Namikoshi became truly famous: they called him 'the man who healed Marilyn Monroe.'</p><p>In the forty-third year of the Showa era (1968), he appeared on the TV program 'Afternoon Show' (the program was on NET, now TV Asahi), which had a high viewership rating. Tokujiro participated in the program, thinking it would be useful for spreading Shiatsu and out of curiosity. In reality, the news that a doctor could diagnose an illness by simply touching the patient caused a great sensation. On the day the program ended, countless calls came to NET. So it was decided to create a new program called 'Shiatsu Lessons.' Needless to say, the program was very successful.</p><p>One day, Mr. Sato, the program director, said to Tokujiro, 'Mr. Namikoshi, I'd like to make the setting more interesting. I thought about displaying some of your sayings.' Tokujiro replied, 'I have just the thing for you,' and brought two paintings with some words engraved in them from the 'Hymn of Praise to Shiatsu,' composed by Tokujiro in the seventeenth year of the Showa era (1942):</p><p>'The heart of Shiatsu is the heart of the mother' 'With Shiatsu, new life is given.'</p><p><i>Sato:</i> 'Beautiful words. They represent your thoughts about Shiatsu very well. Could you recite them during the broadcast, please? But more than just reading them, you should recite them...'</p><p>The television director's requests were always so numerous!</p><p>Thanks to the broadcast, Tokujiro became even more famous. All major TV stations competed to have him, and the number of his students tripled. As if that weren't enough, his students also became highly regarded and sought-after Shiatsu practitioners.</p><p>But TV wasn't Tokujiro's only occupation. He continued to actively run the school and tried to create a movement to promote Shiatsu and gain legal recognition. In the forty-sixth year of the Showa era (1971), he ran as a candidate in the Council of Representatives elections but was not elected. Nevertheless, it was an opportunity for him to better understand the world of politics.</p><p>On September 25th of the twelfth year of the Heisei era (2000), at the age of ninety-four, Tokujiro passed away. A few years before his passing, a bronze statue of him was erected in the school's courtyard (which had meanwhile changed its name to 'Professional Shiatsu School'). At the statue's unveiling ceremony, Tokujiro stood out once again: he poured sake into the statue's mouth. No one ever knew exactly what he was thinking at that moment, but it seems he wanted to offer his beloved sake to the statue. After finishing the sake, he joined his hands and began to pray. Finally, he said, 'Enough, I've had enough. I'm drunk. Hahahahaha.' That day, his laughter echoed for what seemed like an eternity in the clear sky.</p><p>'The heart of Shiatsu is the heart of the mother' 'With Shiatsu, new life is given.'</p><p>So goes the brief story of the great Tokujiro Namikoshi and his thumbs.</p><p><i>Kazuhiro Inada</i></p>"

					"TitoloTeoria": "The Story of Shizuto Masunaga",
					"TestoTeoria": "<p><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/Shizuto_Masunaga.jpg\" class=\"imgDx\"><b>Family Background</b><br>Shizuto Masunaga's family was deeply involved in manual therapies. His father was a Shiatsu practitioner, Judo Seikufu, and a kimono maker. His mother, on the other hand, specialized in Shiatsu and Anpuku, an abdominal treatment technique. Both of his parents were passionate about manual therapies and studied under renowned senseis, such as Tempeki Tamai, Oguro, and Hosomi.</p><p><b>First Encounter with Manual Therapies</b><br>From a young age, Shizuto Masunaga was fascinated by stories of people experiencing extraordinary healings through the power of hands-on touch. His first direct encounter with manual therapies occurred at the age of thirteen when his mother took him to a doctor named Hosomi, who had previously treated her for a blood stasis issue after childbirth. This experience deeply impacted Masunaga and marked the beginning of his interest in manual therapies.</p><p><b>Meeting Tempeki Tamai</b><br>At the age of fifteen, in 1940, Shizuto Masunaga had the opportunity to meet Tempeki Tamai, a renowned Shiatsu practitioner and teacher. This meeting took place during a course organized by Masunaga's father in Kyoto. It can be considered the official start of his journey into Shiatsu. Both his father and mother also received compliments from Tamai for their work in manual therapies.</p><p><b>Influence of Hishi and his <i>Remote Diagnosis</i> Method</b><br>At a young age, Masunaga came into contact with Master Hishi, known for his remote diagnosis method. This method involved simultaneous pressure with both hands on two different points of the same meridian to identify the cause of disorders and alleviate pain. This practice would later play a significant role in the creation of the Shiatsu style known as <i>Iokai</i>.</p><p><b>Namikoshi's Teaching and His Quest for a Deeper Approach</b><br>After studying Namikoshi's Shiatsu technique and obtaining a Shiatsu practitioner diploma, Masunaga taught psychology and Shiatsu at Namikoshi's academy for a decade. However, he believed that Namikoshi's style had deviated from the constant and deep pressure he considered essential. This difference of opinion led to him being seen as a rebel and prompted him to leave Namikoshi's school. Despite the differences, Masunaga maintained deep respect for Namikoshi and acknowledged his fundamental role in popularizing Shiatsu.</p><p>Shizuto Masunaga's incredible journey in Shiatsu is a story of learning, evolution, and the integration of various influences into his practice. He made significant contributions to the development of modern Shiatsu and left a lasting mark in the world of manual therapies.</p>"

					"TitoloTeoria": "The Iokai Style",
					"TestoTeoria": "In the vast world of Eastern therapeutic practices, the Iokai method stands as a unique expression of harmony between body and spirit.<br><br><b>Origins and Philosophy</b><br>The Iokai method finds its roots in ancient Eastern philosophy, particularly in the Chinese system of meridians and pressure points, as well as in the Japanese tradition of Shiatsu. Its creator, Shizuto Masunaga, infused the practice with his profound knowledge of psychology, philosophy, and anatomy, thus creating an integrated approach to the art of Shiatsu.<br><br><b>Energy Balance</b><br>At the core of the Iokai style lies the conception of a harmonious flow of vital energy (Ki) through the human body. Masunaga developed an energy diagnostic system through palpation and listening to the body, identifying energy blockages or imbalances. Specific pressure points are stimulated to restore the energy flow, promoting rebalancing and healing.<br><br><b>Meridians and Key Points</b><br>A distinctive element of this method is the particular attention given to energy meridians and pressure points. Masunaga extended the traditional meridian system, emphasizing the connection between primary and secondary meridians. Each point is considered a gateway for energy with specific meanings and therapeutic functions.<br><br><b>Technique and Application</b><br>In Zen Shiatsu practice, the therapist uses various techniques of pressure, rotation, and stretching to release energy blockages and promote the harmonious flow of Ki. Emphasis is placed on the gradual and deep release of tension, allowing the recipient to experience a sense of renewal and inner calm.<br><br><b>Holistic Benefits</b><br>In addition to treating physical ailments, this style also focuses on the emotional and psychological dimension of the individual. The release of energy tensions can lead to increased self-awareness, reduced stress, and improved emotional balance. This holistic approach to the art of Shiatsu represents an attempt to promote health and well-being on a global level."

				{
					"TitoloTeoria": "The Amoeba Cycle",
					"TestoTeoria": "The <i>Iokai</i> style is based on the energetic concept related to meridians.<br> Masunaga's conceptual structure originated from his curiosity about the arrangement of energy pathways and the importance of the specific effects of these pathways in the body, mind, and emotions. He hypothesized that if the system of energy pathways accurately represents our vital structure and is not an arbitrary or academic concept, there must be a correlation between the energetic functions of the pathways and their location on the body. Starting from this assumption, he took as a starting point the sequence of pathways known in the West as the Chinese Clock. Following this sequence, it is possible to map the entire network of pathways continuously on the body.<br> There is symmetry in the arrangement of pathways in the body and alternation between yin and yang. However, the meaning of this symmetrical sequence has always been primarily associated with the different times of day when the pathways are most active. Masunaga connected this sequence not to a single day, but to an individual's entire lifespan or cycles of activity that occur from birth to completion. To illustrate his theory, he used as a model the lifecycle of one of the simplest living beings, namely a unicellular organism. Therefore, his theory is called the <i>amoeba lifecycle</i>.<br>  <br><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/ameba1.png\" style=\"float:right;width:140px;\"><b>PHASE 1 - Creation of a Boundary and Beginning of Exchange</b><br>  The origin of life on Earth is believed to have occurred in the so-called Primordial Soup, a rich amalgamation of amino acids and nutrients that support life. It is believed that life began through an electrical impulse, perhaps similar to a flash of lightning. The most basic form of life formed in this way, a unicellular organism. This represents the first stage of existence, the formation of an individual identity, distinct from the rest of the universe but coexisting with it. Masunaga defined this energetic action as the Creation of a Boundary, which is the formation of a structure with its own identity. The boundary represents the separation between the amoeba and the universe but must be permeable to allow the exchange of Ki with the universe itself; the amoeba would die if it were completely isolated.<br>  According to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the Lungs control the skin, which forms our permeable boundary. The Lung and Large Intestine meridians extend along our anatomical boundary, forming the exterior of our silhouette when we are in an upright position with our palms facing forward, in anatomical position. The Lungs and Large Intestine represent the functions of receiving and eliminating through the boundary, both essential for resource replenishment. We cannot receive if we are not willing to eliminate. The keywords that summarize this phase of the cycle are vitality through exchange.<br>  <br> <img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/ameba2.png\" style=\"float:right;width:140px;\"><b>PHASE 2 - Meeting Needs</b><br>  In the second phase, once an individual unit has been formed, needs inevitably emerge. The primary need of any life form is to nourish itself. In the case of the amoeba, we can imagine it identifying a particularly enticing food molecule in the Primordial Soup in front of it. Its actions will be:<br><ul>  <li>    extending itself in the front (biologically forming a pseudopod) to reach what it desires  </li>  <li>    enveloping it and starting to break it down and make it digestible  </li></ul><br>The two phases of this part of the cycle represent the activity of the Stomach and Spleen meridians. The active Yang energy of the Stomach expresses appetite, the perception of a need, and the movement toward its satisfaction. The Spleen performs the Yin function of incorporating and phagocytizing the object of need, transforming it into an assimilable form. The object can be anything we consider beneficial for our well-being: not only food but also ideas, love, approval, possessions, and status. The Stomach desires and pursues, while the Spleen regulates possession and the awareness of achievement. The activity in this energetic phase is mainly in the front of the body. Masunaga's keywords for the meridian activity in this phase are appetite and satisfaction.<br>  <br><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/ameba3.png\" style=\"float:right;width:140px;\"><b>PHASE 3 - Assimilation and Integration of Nourishment</b><br>In the third stage of the cycle, the assimilation and integration of previously obtained nourishment occur. The desired object, previously incorporated and transformed into a usable form, is now fully integrated into the individual's identity.<br>This is a process of deep integration, where previously ingested food becomes truly part of the organism.<br>The meridians representing this process are the Heart and Small Intestine. The Small Intestine plays a key role in this stage, as it absorbs nutrients and transforms them into a form that can nourish the Heart. In the context of Zen Shiatsu theory, the Heart is the central core of individual identity and awareness. <br>Through this process, every living being - whether an amoeba, an animal, a plant, or a human being - is able to incorporate what it needs from the external environment. This contributes to maintaining its presence, awareness, and function in the surrounding world. Metabolic and energetic activities at this stage are characterized by an inward movement. The involved meridians are positioned on the inner surface of the limbs, particularly evident when we are in an anatomical upright position.<br>Masunaga's keywords for this stage of the cycle are central control and conversion. It is as if vital energy, after being absorbed and integrated, is now channeled and controlled toward the center of individual identity, the Heart. This stage represents a crucial step in the energetic cycle, as vital energy, through the assimilation and integration of nourishment, is ready for the next step in the being's evolutionary journey. The energetic cycle approaches its central point, represented by the Heart, the center of individual identity and awareness.<br><br><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/ameba4.png\" style=\"float:right;width:140px;\"><b>PHASE 4 - Escape from Danger</b><br>In the fourth stage of the cycle, vital energy confronts situations of danger and threat.<br>The being, now capable of self-sustaining and responding to environmental stimuli, must face urgent circumstances. Imagine an amoeba that, in a later evolutionary era, finds itself in the Primordial Soup and is threatened by a predator. In this stage, the instinct for survival manifests as the need to flee. The perception of danger triggers a movement that takes the amoeba away from the source of the stimulus, in contrast to the previous stage, where the movement was directed toward the source of desire. The Bladder and Kidney meridians take center stage in this stage of the cycle. These meridians are located on the back of the body, providing the driving force for escape. The strong energetic thrust that originates in the back of the body is what Masunaga described as \"impetus.\"<br>In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the Kidneys, through their Yang aspect and the concept of original Ki, provide the energy necessary for the body's actions, functions, and metabolic processes. The energy of the kidney organs is closely linked to the vital impulse and survival activity.<br>Masunaga's keywords for this stage are purify and give impetus, concepts that apply to the Zen Shiatsu medicine system and the perspective of TCM. Additionally, this stage emphasizes the importance of kidney energy in supporting the constant flow and vital movement of the being.<br><br><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/ameba5.png\" style=\"float:right;width:140px;\"><b>PHASE 5 - Circulation and Protection</b><br>In the fifth stage of the cycle, the theme of vital energy circulation and protection is addressed. The amoeba must not only face sudden attacks but also daily adaptation to the surrounding environment, including weather events, temperature changes, pollution, and other external influences.<br>This concept is equally relevant to us humans, as we must protect ourselves from the same factors, as well as defend ourselves against unwanted intrusions into our emotional space. The previous stage (phase 4) is characterized by impetus, which can save one's back and react urgently to dangerous situations. In the fifth stage, attention shifts to a constant form of protection that involves different levels of being. Life in a social group offers a form of protection but also requires constant adaptation. Each individual within the group has their unique identity and functions but also needs to extend awareness outward, create connections with others, and contribute to the collective identity.<br>This balance between individual protection and participation in the social group requires social and emotional mechanisms that can expand the influence of our true selves while also withdrawing to protect it when necessary.<br>The Triple Heater and the Master of the Heart, although not commonly considered in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as meridians with distinct energetic identities, express these mechanisms in Zen Shiatsu theory.<br>The Triple Heater acts as an energetic shield to protect the body's surface from environmental dangers and external influences, including interaction with different personalities. In contrast, the Master of the Heart acts as an \"inner lining\" that protects the individual's emotional center.<br>A visible example of this energetic protection is when we sit with crossed legs and arms in a defensive posture. In this posture, the Triple Heater is clearly evident in its entirety, offering protection to the entire surface of the body. On the other hand, the Master of the Heart is not visible to external observers but is recognizable to the individual as it forms an inner energetic lining.<br>In the perspective of the Zen Shiatsu system, the Triple Heater is associated with the distribution of original Ki and fluid circulation, while the Master of the Heart is involved in assisting and protecting the Heart.<br>Masunaga's keywords for this stage are circulation and protection. This stage represents the need to maintain a harmonious and balanced flow of vital energy, not only to protect the individual from external threats but also to maintain connection and balance within the social group.<br><br><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/ameba6.png\" style=\"float:right;width:140px;\"><b>PHASE 6 - Choosing Direction</b><br>The sixth and final stage of the cycle represents not only the conclusion of a developmental cycle but also the preparation for a new beginning. The amoeba has learned, over the previous steps, a series of fundamental actions to survive and thrive:<br><ul>  <li>    Exchange vital energy with the universe through the boundaries of one's being.  </li>  <li>    Advance in the search for nourishment.  </li>  <li>    Assimilate and use that nourishment.  </li>  <li>    Protect against dangers and adapt to the surrounding community.  </li></ul><br>The evolution of metabolic functions associated with these actions has ensured the formation of a reserve of nutrients and energy in the organism.<br>But now the question arises: how can we best use these accumulated resources?<br>In this stage, attention shifts to the process of formulating questions and their answers.<br>It is in this phase that past experiences and acquired knowledge are reflected upon to make wise decisions regarding future actions and directions.<br>The involvement of the Liver and Gallbladder meridians is crucial here. Located on the sides of the body, these meridians allow turning from one side to another, carefully evaluating different possibilities for action and choice.<br>The amoeba has accumulated a reserve of nutrients through the previous phases of the cycle. According to Masunaga, it is the Liver that serves as a storehouse of these resources, while the Gallbladder regulates their distribution.<br>This view partly aligns with the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, where the Liver is associated with blood conservation and energy flow regulation, while the Gallbladder is involved in planning and decision-making.<br>In the context of Zen Shiatsu, however, the primary role of these meridians is to decide when to store or distribute nutrients within the body. The Liver represents long-term planning, similar to a general organizing reserves for future strategies. In contrast, the Gallbladder plays a more immediate role, like a field officer making instant decisions based on circumstances. Such decisions are made within the realm of action, as the very nature of the Liver and Gallbladder meridians is to drive and direct actions, allowing the individual to express their program and purpose in the present moment. Representing this dynamic in anthropomorphic terms, the amoeba could decide whether to expand into a community of nearby amoebas, dedicate itself to writing a novel, explore and colonize new areas of the Primordial Soup, or even stay at home and face conflicts with those nearest and dearest. <br>The keyword for this stage of the cycle refers to the crucial moment just before decision-making and action, when options are still open: indecision. Ultimately, this final stage completes the amoeba's cycle and embodies Masunaga's proposed method for explaining the successive energetic phases as the being continues its journey through life.<br>In a broader perspective, each stage can be seen as manifesting more or less continuously, reflecting our physical, mental, and emotional processes. The first three phases of the cycle concern the various ways we receive energy: through breathing and natural energy exchange with the universe, obtaining food and satisfying desires, and absorbing and assimilating nourishment on physical, mental, and emotional levels at the core of our being.<br>The last three phases describe the ways we distribute energy within ourselves: the automatic reflex or adrenaline impulse related to survival, the constant warm thrust of circulation that nourishes and protects the different layers of our being, and finally, the release and distribution of stored energy when needed for specific actions."

					"TitoloTeoria": "Meridian Extensions",
					"TestoTeoria": "One of the key concepts in the Shiatsu approach developed by Shizuto Masunaga is that of meridian extensions.<br>This fascinating and complex perspective explores the idea that each meridian, which is a pathway of energy flow in the body, extends far beyond its physical trajectory. Meridian extensions represent a broader energy connection and emphasize the interdependence and interconnectedness of all parts of the body and being.<br><br><b> The Concept of Meridian Extensions</b><br>In Masunaga's style of Shiatsu, each meridian is not limited solely to its specific anatomical path. Rather, each meridian extends and radiates to different parts of the body, influencing not only muscles and organs but also emotional, mental, and spiritual aspects of the individual.<br>For example, consider the Liver meridian. In addition to following a specific path along the body, this meridian also extends to other parts of the body and influences emotional aspects like anger and planning. This connection between a specific meridian and various aspects of being represents the concept of extension.<br><br><b> Interconnection and Balance</b><br>Meridian extensions underscore the importance of interconnection between different parts of the body and the need for harmonious energy balance.<br>In the context of Shiatsu, working with meridian extensions is essential for identifying and addressing energy imbalances. An operator can apply pressure and manipulations along key points of the meridians and their extensions to stimulate energy flow, restoring balance and promoting the overall well-being of the individual.<br>Meridian extensions are a fundamental concept in Masunaga's Shiatsu theory. They remind us that the human body is an interconnected system, and energy flow extends beyond anatomical limitations. Understanding and working with meridian extensions is essential for promoting health and balance on physical, emotional, and spiritual levels.<br><br><b> Correlation of Meridians with Emotions</b><br>In this context, an interesting perspective emerges that links energetic meridians to human emotions. Masunaga developed a map of meridians that goes beyond the traditional approach, attributing specific emotions to each meridian. This view correlates Shiatsu energy points not only with the physical body but also with emotional and psychological nuances. During a session, stimulating points along the meridians aims not only to rebalance bodily energy but also to influence the emotions associated with each meridian.<br><br><i>Lung (LU)</i><br>Associated with breathing, immune defense, and how we interact with the external world, it is also connected to emotions of sadness and grief.<br><br><i>Large Intestine (LI)</i><br>Associated with elimination, both physical and emotional, it is linked to the ability to let go of what is no longer needed.<br><br><i>Stomach (ST)</i><br>Related to digestion and assimilation, it goes further, influencing our ability to nourish ourselves not only through food but also through positive experiences and emotions.<br><br><i>Spleen-Pancreas (SP)</i><br>Associated with digestion and energy balance, but also reflects our ability to nourish ourselves on an emotional and mental level.<br><br><i>Heart (HT)</i><br>Linked to emotions of love, joy, and empathy, as well as blood circulation and cardiovascular well-being.<br><br><i>Small Intestine (SI)</i><br>Associated with separating nutrients from the undigested and mental clarity.<br><br><i>Bladder (BL)</i><br>Associated with toxin elimination and adaptation to changes.<br><br><i>Kidney (KI)</i><br>Connected to vital energy, life force, sexuality, and overall vitality.<br><br><i>Pericardium (PC)</i><br>Related to emotions, heart protection, and the ability to relate to others.<br><br><i>Triple Heater (TE)</i><br>Linked to thermal regulation, fluid flow, and communication between body parts.<br><br><i>Gallbladder (GB)</i><br>Associated with decisions, courage, and fluidity of actions.<br><br><i>Liver (LR)</i><br>Related to emotional balance, flexibility, and planning."

This is because the anatomical configuration allows for a wide range of movements, making extension, flexion, abduction, and adduction easy.<br>It is essential to emphasize that while the thumb is robust, incorrect usage may cause damage to tissues and joints, leading to conditions like tendinitis, arthritis, or other disorders. Therefore, it's necessary to apply correct pressure.<br><br>During the treatment, it's crucial to ensure that the metacarpophalangeal joint remains consistently flexed and that pressure is exclusively applied through the thumb pad. Additionally, it's essential to keep the palm raised, using the fingers for support. Maintaining this posture while applying pressure minimizes stress on the joint, reducing the risk of thumb injuries.<br>However, many people may face difficulty in maintaining this posture, as thumb and hand characteristics vary significantly in terms of shape, size, and flexibility. Therefore, maintaining control of your position and the physiological curves of the spine is necessary to practice without excessive effort.<br><br><br><br><br>  <b class=\"titSezTeo\">Hand and Finger Position</b><br>In this section, we will delve into the various pressure styles used in the context of Shiatsu Namikoshi. Each of them represents a subtle art, a skill that goes beyond mere practice.<br>From the gentle and relaxing approach of certain techniques to the firmer and deeper pressures of others, we will discover how each type of pressure has a specific role in promoting harmony and well-being.<br><br></p><p class=\"szDiv\"><b><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_pollice_singolo.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\">Single Thumb Pressure</b><br>Pressure is applied to the pressure point using the thumb of the hand, with the other fingers providing support. The pressure should be applied perpendicularly to the point for the duration of one breath (approximately 3 seconds).</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_pollici_ad_A.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Two Side-by-Side Thumbs in an A Shape</b><br>Pressure is applied with both thumbs, keeping the tips in contact with each other. Generally, the angle between the thumbs should be about 45°, although it may vary in some cases depending on the area being treated.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_pollici_sovrapposti.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Overlapping Thumbs</b><br>One thumb is placed over the other. Pressure is primarily applied using the lower thumb, while the other one follows the pressure without exerting excessive force.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_medio_su_indice.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Index and Middle Finger</b><br>Pressure is applied using the thumb pad of the index finger, with the thumb pad of the middle finger placed on the last phalanx of the index finger for greater stability.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_medi.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Overlapping Middle Fingers</b><br>Pressure is applied with the lower middle finger, while the second middle finger rests on the nail of the other, slightly increasing the effectiveness of the pressure.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_pollici_a_V.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Two V-Shaped Thumbs</b><br>This pressure is mainly exerted on the limb. Both hands grasp the limb, and pressure is applied with the two thumbs touching each other at a 45° angle to form a V shape.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_indice_medio_a_V.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Spread Index and Middle Fingers</b><br>Pressure is applied simultaneously with the spread index and middle fingers of one hand, forming a V shape on the recipient.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_a_pinza_dita.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pinching Pressure between Thumb and Index Finger</b><br>Pressure is executed by literally pinching the recipient's skin through the contact of the thumb and index finger's pads of the same hand.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_a_pinza.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pinching Pressure between Thumb and Four Fingers</b><br>Pressure is applied by pinching the thumb pad and the four fingers of the same hand.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_tre_dita_singola.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Index, Middle, and Ring Finger Pressure</b><br>Pressure is applied by placing the thumb pads of the three fingers, excluding the thumb and little finger. Generally, this maneuver is executed through vibratory pressure.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_tre_dita_mani_unite.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Index, Middle, and Ring Finger Pressure with Both Hands</b><br>Similar to the previous position, but carried out with both hands.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_palmo_singolo.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Palm Pressure</b><br>Pressure is applied with the entire palm, with the thumb and other fingers gently close to each other. The force comes from the entire body rather than directly from the hand.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_palmi_uniti.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Both Palms</b><br>Pressure is evenly exerted with both palms flat and parallel to each other, with the thumbs touching lightly along the outer edges.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_palmi_sovrapposti.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Overlapping Hands</b><br>Pressure is applied by overlapping the hands, with the fingers gently held together.<br>A variant of this method is the pressure with overlapping hands, where the upper hand is placed in a way that forms a cross with the lower hand.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_eminenza_tenar.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Thenar Eminence</b><br>Pressure is applied using the thenar eminence (fleshy prominence at the base of the thumb) of one hand, while the thumb and index finger press against each other to contract the thenar folds and create power.</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/pressioni_eminenza_ipotenar.png\" class=\"imgTecnica\"><b>Pressure with Hypothenar Eminence</b><br>Pressure is applied with the central portion of the hypothenar eminence (fleshy prominence at the base of the little finger).</p><p><br><br><br><p><b class=\"titSezTeo\">Types of Pressure</b><br><br> <b>Standard Pressure</b><br>This is the most commonly used type of pressure in Shiatsu. Pressure is applied perpendicularly to the point or area being treated. The maneuver has a duration comparable to one breath, about 3-5 seconds, and is executed gently, progressively decreasing the intensity.<br><br><b>Sustained Pressure</b><br>This method is generally practiced with the palm. Intense pressure is sustained for 5-10 seconds and gradually released.<br><br><b>Vibratory Pressure</b><br>This method is usually practiced with one or two palms. Pressure is executed by making the hand vibrate through forearm muscle tension. The vibratory effect is not purely mechanical but is combined with an energetic force from the operator's hara.<br><br><b>Concentrated Pressure</b><br>Concentrated pressure is applied to a single point for 5-7 seconds using the thumb, with pressure gradually increasing in intensity. Once the desired intensity is reached, the pressure is gradually decreased and then reapplied to the same point. This is repeated several times, taking care not to lose contact between the thumb and the patient's skin.<br><br><b>Three-Stage Pressure</b><br>In this method, pressure is applied in three stages: light, medium, and then strong, on a single point, each stage lasting for 5-7 seconds. In each stage, the pressure intensity is applied gradually and then released at the same speed. This operation is repeated, progressively increasing the pressure intensity to achieve different levels of penetration.<br><br><b>Penetrating Pressure</b><br>This involves gently stroking the recipient's skin with the palm of the hand and the fingers pressed together, stimulating the area.</p>"

				   "TestoTeoria": "<p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/strumenti_moxa_sigari.png\" class=\"imgTecnica strumenti\"><b>Moxa Sticks</b><br>Moxa sticks are an essential element of moxibustion, a technique that involves heating specific points on the body to stimulate the flow of energy, known as <i>Qi</i>, and promote overall well-being. These sticks are made from dried leaves of Artemisia vulgaris, a plant known as <i>mugwort</i> or <i>moxa</i> in Japanese. Moxa is transformed into a compact, cylindrical form, which is then burned or heated to transfer heat to pressure points on the body.<br><br><i>Preparation</i><br>The preparation of moxa sticks requires artisanal skill. Firstly, the moxa leaves are carefully harvested and dried to ensure maximum quality and therapeutic potency. Subsequently, the dried leaves are ground into a fine powder and compressed into cylindrical forms, creating moxa sticks. The choice of moxa quality and precision in preparation are crucial for the success of moxibustion.<br><br><i>Application</i><br>To use moxa sticks in a moxibustion session, the operator will ignite them and place them near specific pressure points on the patient's body. The heat generated by moxa sticks penetrates the energy points, promoting blood circulation, stimulating Qi flow, and relieving any energy blockages. The sticks are often kept at a safe distance from the patient's skin to avoid burns, but the heat is still intense enough to be effective.<br><br><i>Benefits</i><br>Moxibustion with moxa sticks is used for a wide range of conditions, including muscle pain, arthritis, digestive issues, and even for promoting fertility in some traditions. The beneficial effects can be attributed to the heat released by moxa sticks, which helps relax muscles, improve circulation, and restore energy balance in the body.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/strumenti_moxa_lana.png\" class=\"imgTecnica strumenti\"><b>Moxa Wool</b><br>In the world of traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine, moxibustion is an ancient and revered practice. One of the most fascinating forms of moxibustion involves the use of moxa wool, a raw material obtained from the same Artemisia vulgaris plant used for moxa sticks.<br>It is produced through a processing method that transforms the leaves of Artemisia vulgaris into soft, thin wool. This wool is infused with the powerful healing properties of moxa, making it ideal for specific and targeted treatments.<br><br><i>Preparation</i><br>The preparation of moxa wool requires great care and artisanal skill. The moxa leaves are carefully selected and subjected to a drying process to remove moisture. Subsequently, the dried leaves are ground into powder and transformed into soft wool. The quality of the material and precision in preparation are crucial to ensure the effectiveness of moxa wool in therapies.<br><br><i>Application</i><br>Moxa wool can be used in various ways, but one of the most common is its use in combination with acupuncture needles. The therapist places the moxa wool on the tip of an acupuncture needle and ignites it. The heat generated by the moxa wool penetrates the skin and specific energy points, producing a therapeutic effect. This practice is known as <i>moxa acupuncture</i> and is used to address a wide range of disorders. In the holistic field, it can also be used by placing a wool ball on a slice of ginger or garlic; the body's heat is enhanced by the anti-inflammatory benefits of these spices.<br><br><i>Benefits</i><br>The use of moxa wool in therapies such as moxa acupuncture or shiatsu can contribute to muscle relaxation, improved blood circulation, and enhanced energy flow in the body. This can be particularly useful for pain relief, improved organ function, and the restoration of energy balance.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/strumenti_moxa_adesiva.png\" class=\"imgTecnica strumenti\"><b>Adhesive Moxa</b><br>In the ongoing development of traditional medical practices, some ancient tools are reinvented and adapted to meet the needs of modern times. Among these, adhesive moxa cones represent a fascinating evolution of traditional moxibustion. They combine the therapeutic power of moxa with the convenience and ease of modern technology. These adhesive cones contain a compact blend of moxa, which can be applied directly to the patient's skin.<br><br><i>Preparation</i><br>The preparation of adhesive moxa cones requires meticulous attention to detail. High-quality moxa leaves are selected and transformed into a compact blend. This blend is then compressed into small cones, often equipped with an adhesive side for direct skin application. Precision in preparation is essential to ensure effective and safe treatment.<br><br><i>Application</i><br>The application of adhesive moxa cones is simple and effective. The operator places the cone directly on the area of the body to be treated and ignites it. As the cone burns slowly, the heat penetrates the skin and specific energy points, producing a therapeutic effect. This method is known for its practicality and is used to alleviate various disorders.<br><br><i>Benefits</i><br>The use of adhesive moxa cones offers many of the traditional benefits of moxibustion, such as muscle relaxation, improved local blood circulation, and stimulation of energy flow. However, their ease of application makes them particularly suitable for self-treatment and ideal for relieving muscle pain and tension.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/strumenti_coppette.png\" class=\"imgTecnica strumenti\"><b>Glass Cups</b><br>In the vast landscape of traditional healing practices, glass cups represent a fascinating and highly effective method for improving health and well-being. These ancient glass cups have been used in various cultures and continents for centuries, and they continue to gain popularity in integrative and alternative medicine. Glass cups are small vessels used to create a suction effect on the skin. Cupping has been practiced in various forms worldwide, from ancient Egyptian and Chinese civilizations to traditional cultures in Africa and pre-Columbian America.<br><br><i>Types</i><br>There are different types of glass cups that vary in terms of glass type, size, and sometimes shape.<br><br><i>Application</i><br>The application of glass cups involves the specific placement of the cups on the patient's skin, often following the body's energy meridians or pressure points. Glass cups are usually briefly heated inside before being applied to the skin to create negative pressure that draws the skin and underlying tissue into the cup. This process can be used on various parts of the body, depending on the treatment's needs.<br>Once applied, the cups are left in place for a specified period or moved along the skin's surface to create a massaging effect. The suction process stimulates local blood circulation and can help reduce muscle tension and improve energy flow.<br><br><i>Benefits</i><br>Cupping with glass cups can offer various benefits, including relief from muscle and joint pain, reduced tension and stress, improved blood circulation, and support for the lymphatic system. This practice can also be used to treat a variety of conditions, including musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory problems, and mental stress.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"szDiv\"><img src=\"sets/meridiani_shiatsu/img/strumenti_coppette_vacum.png\" class=\"imgTecnica strumenti\"><b>Plastic or Silicone Cups</b><br><br>Plastic cups represent a modern and convenient form of suction. These cups have become increasingly popular in the field of integrative and alternative medicine, offering an affordable and highly effective approach to improving health and relaxation. Plastic cups are lightweight and durable tools, often made of materials such as polycarbonate or medical-grade silicone. Unlike traditional glass cups, plastic cups do not require heating to create a suction effect. This makes them practical and suitable for use by therapists and individuals seeking a convenient treatment option.<br><br><i>Usage</i><br>The use of plastic cups is relatively straightforward. The operator places the cup on the area to be treated and creates a vacuum by pulling a small piston or pressing a valve. This creates a suction effect that draws the skin and underlying tissue into the cup. The cups can be left in place or moved along the skin's surface to create a massaging effect.<br><br><i>Benefits</i><br>Plastic cups offer many of the benefits of traditional suction, including improved local blood circulation, reduced muscle tension, and support for tissue healing. These cups are widely used for relieving muscle and joint pain, reducing stress and tension, and as part of general well-being programs.<br>&nbsp;</p>"
