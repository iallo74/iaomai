					TestoTeoria: "<p align=\"justify\">In Chinese medicine, everything revolves around the concept of <b>Qi</b>, which can be defined as \"energy.\" Similar to the Western concept, energy cannot be defined in itself, but its various forms and aspects can be described. In this sense, the concept of disease in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is expressed as an imbalance of the body's various energetic forms and movements. Therefore, the dualism between Disease - symptom = symptom - cure, typical of Western medicine, is eliminated. The purpose of this publication is to provide a support tool for various professional figures who use TCM to varying degrees.<br>In particular:</p><ul> <li><div align=\"justify\">In Shiatsu, since an ENERGY EVALUATION is performed at the beginning (which varies according to different schools). Therefore, the Shiatsu practitioner operates based on the evaluation performed, taking action to rebalance the energetic patterns. Therefore, knowledge of Chinese evaluation points or alternatively, the areas of Masunaga is necessary. The meridians and associated points will then be the areas of intervention for the practitioner;</div></li> <li><div align=\"justify\">In Chinese medical acupuncture, the evaluation is performed through the symptoms and signs observable in the patient, including pulse and tongue examination. The inclusion of the patient's syndrome in classification systems will guide the physician in rebalancing the energy through the choice of key points.</div></li></ul><p align=\"justify\">This small text contains the fundamental concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p>"

					TestoTeoria: "<p>The <em>Lu&#242;</em> channels are divided into four categories based on the depth and flow of <em>qi</em>:<br> - The <b>principal channels</b>, called <em>j&#299;ng m&agrave;i</em>, are straight lines (<em>j&#299;ng</em> means road, path) and the <em>qi</em> flows vertically.<br> - The <b>Lu&#242; channels</b>, known as <em>lu&#242; m&agrave;i</em>, branch out into small channels (<em>Lu&#242;</em> means net) and the flow of <em>qi</em> is horizontal. They are located at a more superficial level, between the skin and the principal channels. They sometimes reach the main joints of the body, which can result in stagnation.<br> - The smaller vessels, called <b>Minute</b> (<em>sun</em>) and <b>Superficial</b> (<em>f&#363;</em>) channels, are located on the surface, just below the skin, and reach every part of the body, forming a dense network.<br> - The <b>Deep Lu&#242; channels</b> are located at a deeper level than the lu&#242; channels and are energetically connected to the blood and blood vessels. Stagnation of blood often leads to chronic disorders associated with the Deep lu&#242; channels.</p><p>Each category of channel corresponds to a type of <em>qi</em>:<br> - The lu&#242; channels correspond to the <em>w&#232;i q&#236;</em> qi.<br> - The Principal Channels correspond to the <em>y&#237;ng q&#236;</em> qi.<br> - The Deep Lu&#242; channels are connected to the blood.</p><p>The Principal Channels are located between the yang and yin connecting channels: <em>w&#232;i q&#236;</em>, <em>y&#237;ng q&#236;</em>, and Blood move in all directions, reaching the Internal Organs. The essence of the Internal Organs is transported from them to the principal channels through the Lu&#242; channels, allowing it to reach all areas of the body.</p><p> <u>Note</u>:<br> The term <em>Lu&#242; channel</em> can have two different meanings:</p><p> - The Lu&#242; channel that originates from a Lu&#242; point and follows a specific pathway (referred to as the 'Lu&#242; channel' or the 'properly defined Lu&#242; channel').</p><p> - The area located between the Principal Channels and the surface of the body, from which the Lu&#242; channels originate. This area, called the 'Lu&#242; channel area', runs along the entire pathway of the Principal Channel, not just the pathway of the properly defined Lu&#242; channel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>FUNCTIONS</b><br>The luo meridians have three main functions:</p><p><i>PROTECTION function</i><br>By being located on the body's surface, they act as a protective system against physical stress and trauma, defending the body from external pathogens (Wind, Cold, Dampness, Heat, Dryness, etc.).</p><p><i>WARMING function</i><br>By bringing Blood to the surface, they contribute to the regulation of body temperature and muscle warming through perspiration. Deep Lu&#242; channels allow Blood to enter the principal meridians.</p><p><i>NOURISHMENT function</i><br>The nourishment function is crucial as it allows Qi to emerge from the depth of the body and spread into the tissues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>TREATMENT</b><br>If an external pathogen attacks a luo meridian, symptoms such as pain and muscle stiffness occur due to Qi stagnation. Therefore, the treatment aims to disperse the excess and restore circulation.</p><p>In cases of prolonged aggression, diseases become chronic. In this case, the function of the luo meridians is to bring the Ying Qi (nourishing energy) to the surface to support the Wei Qi (defensive energy).<br>To treat the luo meridians, luo points are used (see the 'Point Categories' section).</p><p>For example, when Cold or Dampness affect the luo channels, moxibustion can be applied to the luo points.<br>Since the network of luo meridians reaches the entire body, both superficial and deep areas, they are particularly affected by Qi and Blood stagnation, which, if left untreated, can lead to the chronicization of diseases and potentially serious conditions.</p>"

It influences puberty, menstruation, fertility, conception, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause.</p><p>The Conception Vessel begins in the lower abdomen, between the kidneys in women, passes through the uterus, in men through the prostate, and then resurfaces at the perineum. From there, it proceeds along the abdomen and towards the chest: on the abdomen, at the points [.4.CV.*.] and [.7.CV.*.], it connects with the <i>ch&#333;ng mài</i> channel. It moves towards the throat, chin, face, circles around the lips, and enters the mouth.

Below are some of the main clinical applications of the RenMai Meridian:</p><ol>  <li>    <p>Support for the female reproductive system: RenMai is closely associated with the uterus and the female reproductive system. In clinical practice, it is often used to treat gynecological disorders such as amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), irregular menstrual cycles, and menopause-related issues. Regulating the flow of energy in RenMai can help balance hormones and improve reproductive function.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Support during pregnancy: the RenMai Meridian is important during pregnancy as it is involved in the formation and development of the fetus. Its activation and regulation can help reduce the risk of miscarriage and contribute to the overall well-being of the mother and baby throughout the gestation period.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Treatment of emotional disorders: RenMai is also involved in harmonizing emotions and maintaining emotional balance. Its stimulation can be used to reduce stress, anxiety, and irritability, promoting greater emotional stability and a sense of calm.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Support for respiratory disorders: in TCM, RenMai is also associated with the respiratory system, particularly the Lung (LU). Therefore, it can be used to treat conditions such as asthma, chronic cough, and respiratory issues associated with colds and infections.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Relief from headaches and pain: the RenMai Meridian is involved in the flow of energy along the spine and can be helpful in treating headaches, back pain, muscle aches, and tension.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Improvement of overall energy: stimulating the RenMai Meridian can help improve energy flow in the body, increasing overall energy and vitality.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Support for digestive disorders: as RenMai passes through the abdomen, it can be used to treat digestive issues such as nausea, indigestion, and flatulence.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Balance of the endocrine system: RenMai is involved in regulating the endocrine system, which influences the production and release of hormones in the body.

Being part of the channel system, they are involved in the circulation of Blood and <em>qi</em>.<br>Characteristics of tendon-muscle channels:</p><p>- They are located on the surface of the body.<br>- They do not connect with the internal Organs.<br>- They follow the pathway of the Primary Channels (with the exception of some, such as the Bladder Tendon-Muscle channel).<br>- They run along the contour of certain muscles, along the Primary Channels.<br>- They are divided into <b>four groups</b> of three channels each, sharing the same energetic potential (upper or lower limb) and the same polarity (<em>yin</em> or <em>yang</em>).<table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" id=\"tbPunti\"><tr><td bgcolor=\"#999999\"><table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><tr><td bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\">Yang of the leg</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Bladder</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Gallbladder</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Stomach</td> </tr><tr><td bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\">Yin of the leg</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Spleen</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Liver</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Kidneys</td> </tr><tr><td bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\">Yang of the arm</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Small Intestine</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Triple Burner</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Large Intestine</td> </tr><tr><td bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\">Yin of the arm</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Lungs</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Pericardium</td><td bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\">Heart</td> </tr>	 </table></td> </tr>	 </table><p>In accordance with the modern classification of fasciae, the meridians are also divided into deeper Yin and more superficial Yang.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><b>FUNCTIONS</b><br>Muscular (or muscle-tendons) meridians are the most superficial channels of the body and therefore represent the first line of defense against external pathogens. They give rise to a range of symptoms that can be classified into three broad categories:</p><p>- external pathogens (Cold, Wind, Dampness, Fire, Heat, Dryness)<br>- depletion of Blood energy (Xue with Qi) affecting muscles, tendons, and joints<br>- physical and emotional stress, including sports injuries, excessive physical strain, and postural defects</p><p>Before reaching the Organs (Zang) and Viscera (Fu), disorders manifest first in the muscular meridians. As they are composed of connective tissue, muscles, and joints, they serve as the ideal entry points for major external pathogens that can cause illness. In the connective tissue (an integral part of the immune system), pathogens reside and manifest as Excess or Deficiency. Even if the pathogen has penetrated to a deeper level (Primary Channels, Luo, or even into Organs or Viscera) and the disease is complex, symptoms will always appear in the muscular meridians. In such cases, treatment should address deeper levels. Therefore, muscular meridians can also be considered as the site where symptoms of deeper diseases manifest.</p><p><b>TREATMENT</b><br>Treatment of muscular meridians is applied to areas with particular sensitivity (where symptoms manifest, for example) or more precisely to areas where meridians of the same group converge (e.g., Yin of the arm, Pericardium, Heart, and Lungs) called <em>meeting points</em>.</p><p>Treatment of muscular meridians is particularly indicated in cases of chronic pathologies, where the pathology also affects the underlying meridians.</p>"
