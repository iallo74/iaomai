In this sense, the concept of disease in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is expressed as an imbalance of the body's various energetic forms and movements. Therefore, the dualism between Disease - symptom = symptom - cure, typical of Western medicine, is eliminated. The purpose of this publication is to provide a support tool for various professional figures who use TCM to varying degrees.<br>In particular:</p><ul> <li><div align=\"justify\">In Shiatsu, since an ENERGY EVALUATION is performed at the beginning (which varies according to different schools). Therefore, the Shiatsu practitioner operates based on the evaluation performed, taking action to rebalance the energetic patterns.

The meridians and associated points will then be the areas of intervention for the practitioner;</div></li> <li><div align=\"justify\">In Chinese medical acupuncture, the evaluation is performed through the symptoms and signs observable in the patient, including pulse and tongue examination.

				TestoTeoria: "<p>The <em>lu&#242;</em> channels are divided into four categories based on the depth and flow of <em>qi</em>:<br> - The <strong>Principal Channels</strong>, called <em>j&#299;ng m&agrave;i</em>, are straight lines (<em>j&#299;ng</em> means road, path) and the <em>qi</em> flows vertically.<br> - The <strong>lu&#242;</strong> channels, known as <em>lu&#242; m&agrave;i</em>, branch out into small channels (<em>lu&#242;</em> means net) and the flow of <em>qi</em> is horizontal. They are located at a more superficial level, between the skin and the principal channels. They sometimes reach the main joints of the body, which can result in stagnation.<br> - The smaller vessels, called <strong>Minute</strong> (<em>sun</em>) and <strong>Superficial</strong> (<em>f&#363;</em>) channels, are located on the surface, just below the skin, and reach every part of the body, forming a dense network.<br> - The <strong>Deep lu&#242;</strong> channels are located at a deeper level than the lu&#242; channels and are energetically connected to the blood and blood vessels. Stagnation of blood often leads to chronic disorders associated with the Deep lu&#242; channels.</p><p>Each category of channel corresponds to a type of <em>qi</em>:<br> - The lu&#242; channels correspond to the <em>w&#232;i q&#236;</em> qi.<br> - The Principal Channels correspond to the <em>y&#237;ng q&#236;</em> qi.<br> - The Deep lu&#242; channels are connected to the blood.</p><p>The Principal Channels are located between the yang and yin connecting channels: <em>w&#232;i q&#236;</em>, <em>y&#237;ng q&#236;</em>, and Blood move in all directions, reaching the Internal Organs. The essence of the Internal Organs is transported from them to the principal channels through the lu&#242; channels, allowing it to reach all areas of the body.</p><p> <u>Note</u>:<br> The term <em>lu&#242; channel</em> can have two different meanings:</p><p> - The lu&#242; channel that originates from a lu&#242; point and follows a specific pathway (referred to as the 'lu&#242; channel' or the 'properly defined lu&#242; channel').</p><p> - The area located between the Principal Channels and the surface of the body, from which the lu&#242; channels originate. This area, called the 'lu&#242; channel area', runs along the entire pathway of the Principal Channel, not just the pathway of the properly defined lu&#242; channel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>FUNCTIONS</strong></p><p>The luo meridians have three main functions:</p><p><i>PROTECTION function</i><br>By being located on the body's surface, they act as a protective system against physical stress and trauma, defending the body from external pathogens (Wind, Cold, Dampness, Heat, Dryness, etc.).</p><p><i>WARMING function</i><br>By bringing Blood to the surface, they contribute to the regulation of body temperature and muscle warming through perspiration. Deep lu&#242; channels allow Blood to enter the principal meridians.</p><p><i>NOURISHMENT function</i><br>The nourishment function is crucial as it allows Qi to emerge from the depth of the body and spread into the tissues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p><p>If an external pathogen attacks a luo meridian, symptoms such as pain and muscle stiffness occur due to Qi stagnation. Therefore, the treatment aims to disperse the excess and restore circulation.</p><p>In cases of prolonged aggression, diseases become chronic. In this case, the function of the luo meridians is to bring the Ying Qi (nourishing energy) to the surface to support the Wei Qi (defensive energy).<br>To treat the luo meridians, luo points are used (see the 'Specific Points' section).</p><p>For example, when Cold or Dampness affect the luo channels, moxibustion can be applied to the luo points.<br>Since the network of luo meridians reaches the entire body, both superficial and deep areas, they are particularly affected by Qi and Blood stagnation, which, if left untreated, can lead to the chronicization of diseases and potentially serious conditions.</p>"

The distinct meridians follow a deeper pathway compared to the main channels and move from bottom to top, although there are some differences between distinct yang meridians and distinct yin meridians. Both distinct yang and distinct yin meridians start from the extremities and move towards the neck. They differ in the sense that distinct yang meridians pass through the heart, the associated viscera (fu), and the opposing organ (zang), while the distinct yin meridians only pass through the organ.</p><p>These meridians establish connections between the zang-fu organs and the cerebral areas, with their main function being to transport energy to the brain.</p><p>There are 12 distinct meridians, which correspond to the main channels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>FUNCTION</b></p><p>All the distinct meridians converge in the neck and then in the head, where they gather at the <i>Window of the Sky</i> points (see the section on \"Special Points\").<br>As the yin and yang meridians join together to bring all the Blood energy (Xue di Qi) to the extraordinary vessel, the Brain, it is these distinct meridians that nourish the Brain and connect it with the Heart and other organs and viscera.

They give rise to a range of symptoms that can be classified into three broad categories:</p><p>- External pathogens (Cold, Wind, Dampness, Fire, Heat, Dryness)<br>- Depletion of Blood energy (Xue with Qi) affecting muscles, tendons, and joints<br>- Physical and emotional stress, including sports injuries, excessive physical strain, and postural defects</p><p>Before reaching the Organs (Zang) and Viscera (Fu), disorders manifest first in the muscular meridians. As they are composed of connective tissue, muscles, and joints, they serve as the ideal entry points for major external pathogens that can cause illness. In the connective tissue (an integral part of the immune system), pathogens reside and manifest as Excess or Deficiency. Even if the pathogen has penetrated to a deeper level (Primary Channels, Luo, or even into Organs or Viscera) and the disease is complex, symptoms will always appear in the muscular meridians. In such cases, treatment should address deeper levels. Therefore, muscular meridians can also be considered as the site where symptoms of deeper diseases manifest.</p><p><b>TREATMENT</b></p><p>Treatment of muscular meridians is applied to areas with particular sensitivity (where symptoms manifest, for example) or more precisely to areas where meridians of the same group converge (e.g., Yin of the arm, Pericardium, Heart, and Lungs) called <em>meeting points</em>.</p><p>Treatment of muscular meridians is particularly indicated in cases of chronic pathologies, where the pathology also affects the underlying meridians.</p>"
