		consigli: "There is an urban legend that to stop a hiccup attack, you need to scare the person, and if we reason it in terms of TCM, we can see that it's not entirely wrong since the imbalance also comes from an altered Shen (spirit); well, a scare can give Shen that jolt that brings it back into balance and, consequently, stops the hiccup.<br>Most cases of hiccups are brief and go away on their own without the need for specific treatments. However, in rare cases where hiccups persist for an extended period or become bothersome and interfere with daily activities, techniques like drinking cold water, holding the breath, stimulating the palate nerves with sugar spoons, or taking slow and deep breaths can be used to relieve the condition.",

		descrizione: "Myopia is a vision defect characterized by blurred vision when looking at distant objects. It is caused by a refractive error, which results in difficulty focusing. The term 'myopia' comes from the Greek word 'myo,' meaning 'to close,' referring to the typical habit of myopic individuals to squint their eyes to see distant objects more clearly. The cause of this condition is the refraction of light rays from distant objects onto a plane in front of the retina, creating a blurry retinal image. As a result, there is an excess convergence (greater refractive power), causing myopic individuals to see well up close and poorly at a distance.",

		descrizione: "Nausea is the subjective sensation of the need to vomit. Vomiting, on the other hand, is the oral expulsion of gastrointestinal contents due to contractions of the stomach and the muscles of the thoracoabdominal wall. Nausea and vomiting can be symptoms of very different disorders. Nausea is considered primarily a protective mechanism that helps avoid the ingestion of potentially toxic substances. It is sometimes associated with other forms of discomfort (such as stomach pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, or fatigue) and, although unpleasant, can be useful. It is often considered a sign that vomiting is about to occur, although that is not always the case. Nausea should raise concerns when it is associated with head trauma, headache, severe abdominal pain, etc. Vomiting, on the other hand, is a reflex based on a series of coordinated mechanisms that lead to the forced expulsion of the stomach contents through the mouth. Regurgitation and retching, on the other hand, are different phenomena. Regurgitation consists of the reflux of esophageal contents into the deeper part of the pharynx and does not require much effort. Retching, on the other hand, is a stimulus to vomit that is not followed by actual vomiting because the stomach is empty or because the valve separating it from the esophagus remains closed.",

		descrizione: "Otoliths are tiny clusters of calcium oxalate and carbonate, embedded in a gelatinous matrix located in the inner ear. These formations contribute to maintaining balance and, in response to head movements, transmit the sense of acceleration to the otolithic organs of the vestibular system (the utricle and saccule). Being heavier than the matrix that contains them, otoliths stimulate the sensory hair cells in the ear when the head position changes or a movement is initiated. These cells then send signals to the brain, informing it about changes in the body's position in space. Otolithopathy is caused by abnormal detachment that displaces some otoliths from their natural position. These displaced otoliths settle at the bottom of the ampulla between the sensory receptors, and as long as we remain in an upright position, they do not cause any disturbance. However, whenever we lie down or get up, the otoliths move inside the ampulla, triggering a strong impulse to the sensors, which in turn send a sudden signal of rotation to the brain. This causes bothersome dizziness, especially when lying down. The medical term for this disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), and the episodes repeat every time the head changes position, especially when lying down or turning on the side, particularly at night.

Symptoms vary depending on the severity and location of the brain damage but may include weakness or inability to move an arm and a leg, difficulty speaking, balance and coordination problems, and loss of sensation in the affected half of the body.<br>The diagnosis of hemiplegia is based on careful clinical evaluation, imaging tests such as brain magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography, and other neurological tests. Treatment aims to manage the underlying cause of the condition, improve functionality, and the patient's quality of life. Rehabilitation, physical and occupational therapy, and sometimes medications may be used to aid recovery and adapt to the new challenges imposed by paralysis.<br>The outlook for recovery and the degree of improvement vary from person to person, but with the appropriate approach and timely care, many patients can make significant progress toward regaining motor and functional abilities.",
